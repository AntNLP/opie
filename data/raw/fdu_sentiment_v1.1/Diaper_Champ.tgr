S|It contains the smell from our baby's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside.

S|There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!

S|We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.

S|There is also no trick to it.

S|No spinning it or anyhting!

S|Just flip the handle and the diaper is gone!

S|Now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will!

S|We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it!

S|We purchased it based on the reviews, and it really lived up to our expectations.

S|We liked it because:

S|1. It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills.

S|2. You can dump regular trash into it and not feel as though you've wasted plastic.

S|3. It never smelled - at all.

S|Here's the catch for us- our daughter never drank formula, which is what gives baby waste a foul smell, and when she was eating solids we followed the American Pediatric Association recommendation to flush solid products instead of disposing of them.

S|I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations.

S|I just know it really worked for us.

S|The container is hard to open, which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler, and you do have to flip the handle carefully (which has saved more than a few of her toys,too.) I don't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby.

S|FANTASTIC!

S|I find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can't tightly bundle it without a mess, the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is OUTSIDE of the diaper pail.

S|My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag.

S|The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are.

S|I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road.

S|This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.

S|We just had a baby and were debating getting either this product or the Diaper genie and this is what sold us on this product

S|We received this diaper pail as a gift while expecting our second child.

S|and what a Godsend!

S|It is much easier to fill and unload than the Diaper Genie, plus, why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the Dollar Store?

S|unlike the Diaper Genie!

S|I highly recommend this!

S|For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky.

S|Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.

S|I have to say that I am very happy with it so far.

S|I did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it.

S|I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements.

S|It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.

S|I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.

S|My husband and I bought this instead of the Diaper Genie since we didn't want to be bothered with buying refills for the Genie.

S|Well, I suppose this is better than an open pail, but to have a nursery in which there is no unpleasant smell is quite impossible no matter what you use.

S|The bags attach inside the Champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle.

S|(I never know when the Champ is full as there is no way too tell.  Even though not particularly aesthetic, how about making the Champ clear and see-through?) So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.

S|A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.

S|Bag the diaper in this small clean-smelling bag and then chuck it in the Champ.

S|Another tip is to wash out the Champ frequently and spray the inside and lid with Lysol after every full bag is removed.

S|I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!

S|And best of all, no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags!

S|Whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers, this is the truly the only diaper pail to get!

S|My original purpose in buying the Diaper Champ instead of the Genie was to use it with cloth diapers.

S|As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.

S|She never wore even one- the hospital started me on Huggies, and I never turned back (as a side note- if you do have the patience for cloth diapers, pay the extra $ and go for Kushies; they're beautifully made and work very well from what I've heard).

S|Even though I never ventured into the cloth land, I was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life!

S|Opening the Champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- I pinched my thumb a few times before I got the hang of it.
A|T|4|5|empty

S|Being a very economical person, I appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- I never did like the prospect of buying special Diaper Genie refills.

S|If you have a really sensitive nose, I can suggest buying some scented kitchen trash bags to use with the Diaper Champ- since the odor is contained in the Champ, once you have to open it to empty out the full bag, you're quite often greeted with a rather unpleasant blast of odor, and scented bags help with that.

S|As one other reviewer pointed out, it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the "plunger" to get the diapers in the pail, even though upon inspection the bag doesn't really look full.

S|But from my experience, by the time it gets to that point, the bag is really heavy, so I think this is kind of helpful- it's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying.

S|This is a really great buy, for yourself or as a shower gift.

S|I'm beginning to think that the main reason Genie's so popular is their cutesy name.

S|The Champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year.

S|I cannot speak to the accuracy of its odor containing capabilities due to it was working overtime with 2 childrens diapers.

S|If you have only one child the Champ may last you until the child is out of diapers.

S|We read the reviews on and saw that people liked it much better then the Diaper Genie, but I'm not 100% sure.

S|We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used.

S|We resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the Diaper Champ for wet diapers only.

S|We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped.

S|This eventually ruined the foam pad that is applied to the flip top to keep odors in.

S|I had to go and pull the crumpled foam out just so we could turn the lid.

S|But like I stated, its better then a trash can, but I'm not sure if its better then the Diaper Genie.

S|It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.

S|At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!

S|As the bag fills, you may need to flip twice to ensure that the weighted cylinder has completely pushed the diaper into the bag.

S|For the first 9 months or so, we only needed to empty this once a week.

S|Now that our son's diapers are a little larger, they take up more space, and we empty twice a week.

S|We have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck (we always wrap them in the dirty diaper).

S|It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!

A|T|5|6|ODOR

S|No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.'
A|T|11|12|diaper odor

S|In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.

S|For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:  

S|1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!

S|I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week.

S|For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!! 

S|Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.

S|2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!!

S|Hello, it does house dirty diapers!! 

S|All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.

S|SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!

S|Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind: AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!

S|In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful.

S|Again, this is because as their diet changes, so does the consistency and odor of their stool, in other words, it gets stinkier!!!  

S|All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.

S|I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it, and that helps, but when its hot out- well, just be prepared.

S| We used this diaper pail from the day we brought our son home, until about 13 months.  

S|That's when it went from Oderless, to ODEROUS!

S|Even when empty!

S|So, I took it to the tub, scrub it down with disinfectant.  

S|It still smelled.

S|So then I used straight bleach.  

S|That seemed to work -- for about 3 days.  

S|Then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not.

S|However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered - PROS - 

S|Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.

S|The height is a more convenient reach than others, where you have to hunch over.
