S|near perfection 

S|i love photography . 

S|i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera . 

S|i needed something with more power , so i bought a nikon coolpix 4300 .

S|not too excited 

S|i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon powershot s400 . 

S|reason for two ? 

S|it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid . 

S|the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing . 

S|i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever . 

S|with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ; 
A|R|O|8|9|good|T|4|6|picture qualities
A|O|8|9|good
A|T|4|6|picture qualities

S|1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable . 
A|O|5|6|transfer
A|T|2|3|pictures
A|R|O|5|6|transfer|T|2|3|pictures

S|i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader . 

S|card reader is included . 

S|2 . the speed is noticeably slower than canon , especially so with flashes on . 
A|O|6|7|slower
A|T|3|4|speed
A|R|O|6|7|slower|T|3|4|speed

S|3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip . 
A|T|4|5|battery
A|O|3|4|low
A|R|O|3|4|low|T|4|5|battery

S|i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar . 

S|be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries . 

S|only " cons " here

S|the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree . 

S|but there are certain issues might be they are to me here - all of them are minor; not major ones though , 

S|. this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped . 
A|T|7|9|auto mode
A|T|12|13|sound
A|R|O|11|12|buzzing|T|12|13|sound
A|O|11|12|buzzing

S|would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing . 

S|. if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software " nikon view " which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data . 

S|so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time . 

S|in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time . 

S|. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image 
A|R|O|8|9|distorts|T|6|7|shakes
A|O|8|9|distorts
A|T|6|7|shakes

S|. images taken indoor were n't so clear . 
A|O|7|8|clear
A|R|O|7|8|clear|T|1|2|images

S|you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit 

S|. lens cap is a really annoying 
A|O|6|7|annoying
A|R|O|6|7|annoying|T|1|3|lens cap
A|T|1|3|lens cap

S|. go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card . 

S|else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately " fine **" picture quality  " image size : 1600 . 

S|. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that . 
A|T|2|4|movie clips
A|O|10|11|noise
A|R|O|10|11|noise|T|2|4|movie clips

S|but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .

S|i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem . 

S|worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty ! 

S|they would n't repair my camera unless if i pay $ 100 for parts ? and labor ! 

S|it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .

S|i am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world . 

S|nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .

S|here were my requirements in a digital camera : 

S|1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 " or 5x7 " prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 " photos once in a while . 

S|2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that . 

S|i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily . 

S|3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings . 

S|4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much . 

S|depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models . 

S|nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes , medium; compact size , price , brand name , good software that is included and previous reviews .

S|a few things that might make it even better : 

S|1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .

S|2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow . 

S|3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture . 
A|O|6|7|hazy
A|T|3|4|pictures
A|R|O|6|7|hazy|T|3|4|pictures

S|all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints . 

S|try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems . 

S|whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty . 

S|and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness . 

S|hope this review has helped you in making up your mind . 

S|i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience . 

S|i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now .

S|with our compact 35mm broken , and a vacation in europe at hand , i finally decided to enter the digital age .

S|a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on " normal " resolution . 

S|i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results . 

S|even at the " normal " setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a " digital " . 

S|the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .

S|anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix . 

S|focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange . 

S|pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry . 

S|pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent . 

S|the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models . 

S|anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix . 

S|i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about . 

S|however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .

S|my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months . 

S|in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse . 

S|4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .

S|it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade ! 

S|we got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend . 

S|the only drawbacks that i have noticed : 

S|it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot . 
A|T|4|6|rechargable battery
A|O|14|15|long
A|R|O|14|15|long|T|4|6|rechargable battery

S|so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging . 

S|it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light . 
A|T|5|8|auto-focus assist light

S|i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things . 

S|it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras . 

S|for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length . 

S|it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality . 

S|i set the camera to the " manual " mode for one main reason : 

S|in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries . 

S|in manual , you can set it to " single af " where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features . 

S|in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models ! 

S|it is easy to " focus " in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .

S|recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .

S|try to buy a high capacity ultra card , as it 's 2x as faster as the regular cf card . 

S|consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it 's well worth the little extra money . 

S|an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into " out of battery " situation . 

S|use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run . 

S|one thing puzzles me is that for " fine and 2200 + " quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up . 

S|i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per . 

S|anybody can explain that ? 

S|a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .

S|first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake . 

S|for three months , i 've researched the internet and magazines , queried various sales personnel , and took hands-on in-store test drives . 

S|and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .

S|an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment . 

S|3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust . 

S|i 'll still use my photosuite for editing . 

S|one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing .

S|i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit . 

S|i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand . 

S|i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set . 

S|this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters . 

S|i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time . 

S|this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap . 

S|the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .

S|i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down . 

S|i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond . 

S|i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .

S|i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one . 

S|this one was rated very high by several people check out this site and epinions.com . 

S|i have not been disappointed with my purchase . 

S|picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm . 
A|O|6|7|indistinguishable
A|T|0|2|picture quality

A|O|12|13|good
A|T|3|5|indoor shots
A|R|O|12|13|good|T|3|5|indoor shots

S|however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .

S|i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion . 

S|buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short . 

S|do n't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card . 

S|you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution . 

S|i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember : 
A|O|17|18|confusing
A|T|15|16|controls
A|R|O|17|18|confusing|T|15|16|controls

S|read the directions ! 

S|the regular mode in this camera works for 80 % of settings . 

S|the " scene " mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a " regular " setting . 
A|T|1|5|" scene " mode
A|R|O|6|7|well|T|1|5|" scene " mode
A|O|6|7|well

S|i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos . 

S|however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take . 

S|buy this camera , you wo n't regret it .
