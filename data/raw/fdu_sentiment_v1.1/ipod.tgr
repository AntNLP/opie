S|Get an ARCHOS Gmini400 instead	 If you are doing your research and thinking whether iPod is right for you...      give the ARCHOS Gmini400 a look.

S|Still not so sure about this one...	

S| First, let me say that I got the 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself. 

S| So far, in the month that I have had it, I have had to take it in for service twice.

S|  This is a hassle, of course, but I'm not sure if the problems are to blame on poor construction, cold weather, or misuse by yours truly.

S|  Again, another hassle. 

S| To be sure, I am not looking forwards to paying for the battery replacement, whenever that may come.  

S|But enought of the negativity. 

S| I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.

S| Sound quality is more dependant on the quality of the original source and of the unit used to broadcast (headphones, stereo, etc).  

S|Other than the fact that one can't delete a file directly from the iPod, the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use.

S|Someone wrote that they haven't been able to upload songs from burned cds; I have not found this to be so.

S|  In the end, I haven't used it long enough to say that it is worth the extra money. 

S|Do your research before you buy it, and especially talk to other owners.      

S| i've had a beastly experience from trying to buy an ipod from circuit city. 

S|when i got the ipod, i slid the box out of its sheath and the whole thing tumbled out! 

S|simply put somebody had already opened the box earlier!

S| the packing inside was in tatters. 

S|i didnt touch the product. 

S| i called circuit city and complained that they had sent me an already opened box.

S| they initially told me that i would have to ship it back to them on my own cost. 

S|then when i argued with them they told me that they would pick it up.

S| a week passed but it was never picked up.

S| the when i called they said they werent responsible for open packages because they couldnt verify it being open when i received it (why else would i want to return it if not for this? if the product was defective i would have complained so) and that if i returned it i would have to pay a 15% restocking fee!  i'm at my wits end with this company. 

S|buyers BEWARE!

S| Unless you have an enormous music/audio book library, the 20 GB model should have more than adequate storage capacity, with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs.  

S|At an average of 14 cuts per CD, that's over 350 CD's. 

S|This version does not come with a dock, although it can be added later as an accessory.  Y

S|You can use it to listen to music or audio books, either downloaded via the internet or added to your music library using your CD drive.

S| Features: click wheel to navigate; ability to work with Windows or Mac; optional backlighting (you can have it on all the time, or have it shut off to save battery power after 5, 10, or 20 seconds); ability to download PDA info; automatic or manual download from iTunes when iPod is plugged into your computer. 

S|There's even an equalizer (under "settings") that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic, bass booster, bass reducer, classical, dance, "deep", and electronic.

S|  With accessories, you can make the iPod into a digital recorder, broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology, and play it through your car speakers using either a CD adaptor or FM stereo broadcaster. 

S| The iPod comes formatted for the Mac, but within seconds of plugging it into a PC, is automatically reformatted for Windows.  (The HP version comes with Windows formatting, and takes seconds to change to Mac.) Although the iPod can be changed from one format to another, you will lose all of your music and data when doing so. 

S|Both platforms work seamlessly with the iPod.

S| The box comes with iPod, ear buds, iTunes and iPod software, USB 2.0 and FireWire cables, and a home charger. 

S| You  will need a computer with a six-pin FireWire or USB 2.0 port (USB 1.1 

S|For Mac owners, you'll need Mac OS X 10.1.5 or later (10.3.4 or later is recommended) and your machine must have the appropriate ports built-in.

S| PC users must have a processor of 500 MHZ or faster, Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4 or later or Windows XP, with the ports either built-in or expanded with a card. 

S|ITunes can be downloaded from the enclosed CD or for free from the Apple site.

S|However, it fell into one of Apple's worst reputations. 

S| It is very closed to services and programs outside of Apple's small (though luxiourious, admittedly) island. 

S| However, they close you off from exploring the continent that is other music providers.  

S|After hearing about the new Napster service for portable MP3 players, I was anxious to try it out. 
A|R|O|13|14|anxious|T|5|7|Napster service
A|O|13|14|anxious
A|T|5|7|Napster service

S| This type of service is one that Microsoft is touting...  one where you pay a flat rate per month for unlimited music downloads. 

S| So it was not any surprise that I could not try out this new type of service.  

S|Apple closed their island to anything that resembled Microsoft, and clearly let Napster know it could not use their products with Napster's services. 

S| This has been the case with all other competing music services and Napster.  

S|Why would they let anything compete with them when they are making millions from song downloads by iPod owners who have no other choice?

S|  If Apple makes no attempt to at least create an equivalent type of service, they are failing to compete with the market. 

S| And if they treat their customers like herding sheep, I see little reason to purchase another MP3 player with a bitten apple embroidered on it. 

S| Battery non-issue. 

S| The iPod batteries can go through a full recharge cycle 400 times.

S| If you listen to the iPod four hours per day and you get 10 hours per recharge cycle (not the full twelve specified by Apple) then the iPod will give you over 2.5 years of daily listening.

S|  Apple provides a good discussion of the battery technology at www.apple.com/batteries (and this web address is noted in the iPod manual)

S|  My earlier generation (15Gb) iPod lasted two years, shortened by my own inattention to the simple maintainence asked by Apple (go through at least one charging cycle per month, and don't store the iPod in a car on a summer day because high temp. is harmful to the battery's life). 

S| Finally, if your battery gives out, you can use any number of reputable iPod services to swap it out for <$50 and you're good to go for another 2.5 years (or longer if battery technology improves.)

S|No big deal.  

S|You might change the battery once before the iPod is superceded by something a lot better and less expensive.

S| In fact you may get a newer-better-cheaper device before you get to that point.

S|As a Windows user, I had to install the software including drivers and iTunes on my desktop, and this is the only area where I encountered a nuisance.

S|Eventually I had to uninstall the whole works and reinstall it from scratch, and from then on it has worked like a dream.

S| I still give the iPod five stars, though, as it could have been something I did incorrectly during the install (though I did follow the onscreen prompts) so I'll give Apple the benefit of the doubt.

S|The iPod does come with other nifty software accoutrements, but honestly I haven't used them much as I use the iPod to listen to music while I run or on a plane. 

S|The battery holds a charge for a very long time (maybe 15 or so hours of use) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with iPod use.

S|  Using the software iTunes is relatively simple, you just plug the USB cable in, wait your machine to detect the iPod and voila, any songs listed in your iTunes library will be transfered on over to the iPod.

S| Now if you do decide to take the iPod on the road, my suggestion is to forego any purchasing of the FM Transmitter devices, unless you live out in the middle of Mississipi because frankly, you'll need a next-clear FM channel on your radio to get any sembelance of a clear signal. 

S| I actually hooked up the iPod to my receivers AUX port with a Pbus connector and a Y-splitter cable, it wasn't too hard to do and now, I can listen to all my music in my car without ever having to lug around CDs again.

S| And, with the iPods' full volume up, all you have to do is adjust your receivers' volume and your set, since the iPod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its' own.

S| This review will contain some comparisons to other MP3 players (mainly the Rio Nitrus) for interested consumers.

S| If you want to know exclusively about the iPod, you'll find that here too!  RIO VS. IPOD  For Christmas I was given a Rio Nitrus (1.5 GB) and was extremely pleased with it. 

S|However I looked up some consumer reviews online only to find out it had the shortest warranty of any MP3 player on the market, and was notorious for having poor customer service and completely breaking after 90 days (when the warranty expires, surprise, surprise). 

S|I still have my Nitrus and stand by it so far - a month has nearly passed and it's still working flawlessly.

S|  However after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority. 
A|O|12|13|superiority

S|For a sleeker, smaller and more "average" MP3 player the Nitrus is great but the iPod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful.

S| It "feels" much more professional and well built - the clickable scroller, for example, is a brilliant invention and I never feel as if I'm going to perhaps break it or snap it off (as I sometimes did with the Nitrus).

S|  THE CONS OF THE IPOD  There are a few advantages to the Nitrus. 

S|You can transfer music from one PC to the other.

S| However, with the iPod you cannot. 

S|The music MUST be on your computer.

S| If you plug your iPod into a PC and try to upload music/etc. it won't work.

S|Someone told me that he had a 40 GB iPod, and after his computer crashed he lost his paid iTunes music files. 

S|They were on his iPod, but the device would not let him upload the files onto his new computer; and after he tried, the iTunes software deleted the files from his iPod, assuming they were stolen (?). 

S| Also, some other MP3 players such as the Nitrus allow you to play WMA (Windows Media Audio) files, whereas the iPod does NOT. 

S|Considering the fact that just about any CD you purchase and "rip" to your hard drive will be formatted as a WMA file, iTunes version 4.5 (included with new iPod releases) contains an auto-converter that converts WMA to MP3 for iPod compatability.

S| My only nitpick with this is that it sometimes doesn't work on certain files and presents error messages. 
A|T|2|3|nitpick

S|I had similar trouble with my Soundgarden CD - the ripped tracks continually failed to convert properly to MP3.  
A|O|3|4|trouble
A|T|6|8|Soundgarden CD
A|R|O|3|4|trouble|T|6|8|Soundgarden CD

S|So, I downloaded another program (Switch freeware) and manually changed the WMA files to MP3, then downloaded them to the iPod.

S| The problem with this is that a) it takes a LOT of time if you have many files and b) audio quality is somewhat lost (if you're an audiophile, this will bother you - frankly, I can't tell the difference).  
A|R|O|24|25|lost|T|20|22|audio quality
A|T|20|22|audio quality
A|O|24|25|lost

S|Also, I don't like how when I first set up my iPod, it took me about four hours to get everything going - the new iTunes software has an exploited flaw which is that if you do not connect your iPod to your PC during installation, it will not configure the iPod, and when you later plug it into your computer the PC will recognize it as an external device rather than an actual iPod, and you will not be able to use the iTunes software until you access your device manager and change the iPod "hard drive" to a new letter.
A|R|O|30|31|flaw|T|24|27|new iTunes software
A|T|24|27|new iTunes software
A|O|30|31|flaw

S| If this sounds confusing, just make sure you have your iPod plugged in when you install the iTunes software! 

S| This seems obvious but the flaw lies herein: the instruction booklet tells users to charge their iPods 2 - 4 hours before initial use. 

S|In the meantime, users will obviously begin to install their software - and since the charger takes up the underbelly of the iPod and USB connection to the computer, it's impossible to hook it up to your PC during installation without unplugging the charge adapter and actually turning the iPod on - which we're not supposed to do for 2 - 4 hours!  

S|Confused yet? Don't be.

S| This is really the only downside to the iPod - setting it up and downloading music. 

S|The actual experience of USING the iPod is magnificent.

Once you've downloaded your music, you can access the tracks by artist, genre, album, composer (this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e.g. covers of songs), etc.

S|Don't apply the black cushioned protectors. 

S|First of all, no one does this and it will make you stand out and look "uncool."

S| Just kidding.

S| But really, EVERYONE I've seen with an iPod leaves them off. 

S|But unlike most fashion statements (if this could indeed be seen as one?) this concept is a logical one - the black cushions often cover up the letters on the earbuds that designate whether they're for your left or right ear.

S| I had to constantly peel mine off to see which was which, so I finally just got rid of the cushions and don't even notice the difference.

S|  The ease of use of the iPod is a major attribute.

S| With the iPod, you can also store documents and contact files (from programs such as Microsoft Outlook) when it's connected to your PC as an external hard drive. 

S|This is good for the businessmen who listen to music on their commute and can rely on the iPod to even carry around some of their word documents.

S| I'm sure future generations of the iPod will be able to carry much more, probably even videos.  

S|Also included in the "games" section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs.

S|The game plays a segment of a song, and gives you a multiple-choice list wherein you have a short period of time to choose the title of the song from a list of others. 

S|  What's great about this is that it's a game based on YOUR music.

S|When I first saw "music trivia quiz" I thought it was some pre-programmed elitist thing - it's not.

S| It's a lot of fun and really tests your reflexes. 

S|It's a good way to pass the time.

S|  20 GB OR 40 GB?  The pros of the 40 GB: Comes with a "dock station" and double storage space (10,000 songs).

S|  Cons of the 40 GB: Much more expensive just for some extra space and a docking station, both of which you don't really need.

S| Think about it for a minute - the 20 GB holds 5,000 songs: more than you're ever likely to need at any one time.

S| If you want to add more, just delete some that you haven't been listening to recently.

S| I mean, for music buffs and archivists - use your PC as the archive, not the iPod! 

S|It's just my personal advice but you're saving a lot of money and from personal experience the docking station is really sort of a rip-off - based on the sleek design of the iPod, it's very easy to simply lay it down without damaging it or anything.

S|  Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it.

S|Because Steve Jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an UNREPLACABLE 18 MONTH BATTERY. 

S| To see a great little short film about this, go to ipodsdirtysecret.com  ##Basically, this is a disposable device, the idea being that when the battery goes out, you will buy the latest model of ipod.

S|  This was obviously a conspiracy as it is FREAKIN' EASY to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries!!

S|    If you can get past this little flaw, give the ipod 5 stars, because everything else about it is pretty much perfect.  

S|However, in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS. 

S| Hence, the one star rating...     

S|Good, But Not For Everyone

S| I was shopping for a MP3 player recently, and had the opportunity to play with my cousin's 20GB iPod at some length to see how I liked it.

S| I had initially been planning on buying this or another Apple product, but since decided to buy a player made by a different manufacturer.

S|  Overall, I think the iPod is a good player, although I would note some features that turned me off: 
A|T|4|5|iPod
A|R|O|7|8|good|T|4|5|iPod
A|O|7|8|good

S| LOOKS AND DURABILITY: I realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface.  

S| I'm not one of them.

S|  While I like the minimialism of the player, I try to avoid plastic products made of white- they tend to yellow with age. 

S|While they have released those "tattoos" for the players, I think those just look cheap and gaudy, especially since they leave the corners of the iPod exposed.

A|O|16|17|gaudy

S|The biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin's player was relatively new, it was riddled with scratches.

S|  While he's not the most careful guy in the world, it was really beat up consider the minimal amount he uses the thing, and talking to other people who have iPods confirmed that the player scratches very easily- and from personal experience, they look terrible scratched up.

S|THE CLICKWHEEL: Again, I realize that most people think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread. 

S| I disagree. 

S| I strongly suggest anyone considering an iPod test it out first to see how they like it. 

S| I thought the clickwheel sounded great, but after trying it found it awkward.

A|R|O|12|13|awkward|T|3|4|clickwheel

S|As a student, I spend a significant amount of time on my laptop and am used to scrolling up and down on the touchpad, which made the Creative Zen Touch a more attractive product for me. 
A|O|32|33|attractive
A|T|27|30|Creative Zen Touch
A|R|O|32|33|attractive|T|27|30|Creative Zen Touch

S| Be sure you test this first to see if it does feel intuitive for you, rather than just going on the fact that it does sound pretty neat. 

S| BATTERY: Compared to the other players on the market, the iPod has one of the worst batteries around.
A|T|16|17|batteries
A|O|15|16|worst
A|R|O|15|16|worst|T|16|17|batteries

S| The Sony Walkman and Creative Zen Touch get 30 and 24 hours per charge, respe

S| Since no company has yet to come out with an interchangeable battery for the jukebox-sized players (the Creative Labs Zen Micro is the only one I'm aware of that has this, and it's 5 GB), this can be an issue.  

S|IN SUMMARY: This is a good, basic player.  It's not for everyone, and if you're in the market for one I suggest that you try to put aside the huge popularity of the iPod and look harshly at the actual features that the other players on the market have, and see how they stack up.

S| Apple is already being outpaced by Creative Labs and Sony on the battery front, and just about any non-Apple player allows you more compatibility with download services than Apple's iTunes-only program.

S|  But since a lot of these MP3 players are marketed on aesthetics, do go to your local store or borrow a friend's and see how the product actually feels and works.

S|  This may be the player for you, but it's not leaps and bounds ahead of any other player, and others are ahead of it in certain areas, so practice some caution when you buy.     

S|	Pure And Simple, Wonderful Stuff.

S|	 If, like me you simply want an iPod to play your mp3's, buy this one. 

S|If you want colour screens, photos, videos etc, buy the latest (extremely expensive) model, I think the new 60GB has all the extras. 
A|T|17|19|new 60GB

S|This 20GB just plays the songs, most people won't even use the 20GB space, I've got about 1500 songs on mine that adds up to nearly 13GB.

S|  I would strongly recommend the iPod over rival mp3 players such as the Creative Zen and the creatively named iRiver. 
A|O|3|4|recommend
A|T|5|6|iPod
A|R|O|3|4|recommend|T|5|6|iPod

S|Most importantly because the iPods warranty is far superior to both these, the Creative Zens is only 90 days, way too short. 
A|O|8|9|superior
A|T|4|6|iPods warranty
A|R|O|8|9|superior|T|4|6|iPods warranty

S|The iRivers is also short, and lets face it, what is more likely to brake or go wrong, the Apple iPod or Creative Zen, iRiver. 

S|Both from unspecialist makes, and in Creatives case a company that deals mostly in computer parts, and has not invested the money that Apple has. 

S|So reliability is the winner here for the iPod.
A|R|O|1|2|reliability|T|8|9|iPod

S|  As far as an actual player is concerned, the iPod is next to none.

S| The one advantage the iRiver has is it can play wma files aswell as mp3s, unlike the iPod. 

S|But all you need to do is convert the files (besides mp3s are larger and better quality files than wmas) using a wide range of convertors, my favourite is the dBPowerAmp Music Coverter which also allows you to burn directly from cd to hardrive in mp3 format unlike Media Player.
A|T|30|33|dBPowerAmp Music Coverter

S| It's well worth it, the mp3s do in fact sound better.

S| Quite simply, BUY THE IPOD, whatever size you wish. 

S|I would go along the lines of any more than 2 thousands songs, get a larger size such as the 40GB, just to be on the safe side.

S|Just don't drop it.

S| I had the 15G iPod of the previous incarnation. 

S| Actually I had two: the first one stopped working within a month so I took it back, and they exchanged it (which is evidently pretty extraordinary - guess I lucked out.  I didn't tell them I had dropped it once). 

S| Then I had the second one in my boyfriend's car, and his car got jacked.  

S|Fortunately his insurance covered it (also extraordinary), and as luck would have it, this new gen of iPods came out the same week he got the check.

S|  So I got a free 5G upgrade out of that misfortune.

S|  I also got to see just how utterly addicted I am to my iPod in the few weeks I had to go without one.

A|R|O|8|9|addicted|T|13|14|iPod

S|  The major change from the previous model, other than the extra 5G for the same price, is that this one is slightly smaller and lighter, and the already minimal buttons (menu, play/pause, forward and back) have now been assigned to the four quarters of the click wheel, so that even less brain power is required to search through your 10,000 stolen mp3s. 

S| Mac is really big on streamlining everything (maybe that's why you never get a decent manual with any of their products).

S| I like the click wheel OK, but actually the one problem I've had with this, my third, iPod is that occassionally the wheel gets "stuck," meaning either it won't respond at all, or it "jumps" down playlists uncontrollably.

S|I don't really intend to drop mine to find out. 

S| The thing is, naturally you're going to use your iPod at the gym or whatever, and it can be a bit of a liability because you always feel like you have to protect it.

S| Not that anybody would revert back to their old-skool walkman just because you can knock it around more.  

S|The thousands of songs at your fingertips thing, you just can't beat that with a stick.  

S|But seriously though, how bout we work on the durability thing for the next gen.

S| We can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong, and thus eliminate the need for third-party "iSkin" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks.

S| The other thing is the earbuds.  

S|First of all, I've never been big on earbuds - they're just not that comfortable.

S|  These are nice ones, and you get great sound at first, but again, they break if you even think mean things about them. 

S| With both pairs I had ceramic rattling in my ears by month two. 

S| And I'm really not that rough with things! 

S| These issues aside, the iPod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one, you can't be without one.

S|  Mac has at least cornered the mp3 player market across the board.

S|  PC users have a lot of choices, but based on what I've heard and read, the iPod really is the best all-around, athough being a Mac product, it has the usual streamlined and comparatively less customizable software.

S|  Buy the 20GB instead of the Mini	 

S|A lot of the reviews I've read talk about IPODS in general.

S| I'm writing about the 4G IPOD 20GB model.

S| I ordered the mini from amazon, and while waiting for it to arrive I wandered into the Apple store.  

S|I'm glad I did.

S|  After talking to the salesman, I instead bought the 4G, 20GB (that stands for 4th generation; it looks like a mini - same features), and didn't know that a lot of the ipods out there for sell, including on amazon, are still 3G.

S| The player is great.

S|There is an attachment you can buy that allows you to use AA batteries in an emergency, but...I've never completely run out of juice; just dangerously low on long airline trips. 

S| For about $5! 6 dollars, you can get an "extended warranty" and apple will replace the battery within 2 years if it dies.

S|  Think about that if you are worried about battery life.

S| held out for the 4th generation 20GB iPod when I heard that it was coming equiped with the 'click wheel', that had previously only been available for the iPod 'mini'. 

S|I found that to be the most impressive thing about the iPod 'mini' - basically for ease of use, and the feel it gives.

S|It takes seconds to work the menus and go from song to song.  

S| This unit comes with the USB/firewire cable as a standard item now. 

S|Does not come with the dock, remote control, or carrying case like the 3rd generation units - but you get $100 off the price, so you can still end up with the same accessories, and a new generation iPod for the same money.

S|  I have transferred in about 2,400 tracks so far - very easy to use both the Ipod and iTunes.

S|The first battery charge lasted only about six hours. 

S|That may be due to the fact that I used the menus a lot, and had it hooked up to the Griffin iTrip (The iTrip works great) for most of that time.

S| The second battery charge lasted over twelve hours.

S| I used it mainly on shuffle play and shut off the "click" sound to get this much life out of it.   

S|I was worried about what the sound quality would be like, but that seems to be just as good as the actual CD sound.

S| After about 3-4 months, you see your battery draining faster than it should. 

S|After a year, your battery is dead and you need to replace it with a new one. 

S|Apple's iPod battery replacement service costs $100! 

S|Amazing.

S| You pay $300 for the iPod itself, then $100 to get the battery fixed. 

S|If you look on Google or around the web's many search engines, you can find a site that will replace the battery at a cheaper price. 

S|Apple needs to step it up and get better, longer lasting batteries.     

S|Not perfect, but I'm still enamored...	 I've had an iRiver MP3 player for a year or so now, and it's really great for listening to the radio. 

S| It's small and lightweight, but it has very little storage space and the shape is clunky.

S| I have no clue why this happens, as they show up perfectly in my iTunes library and there was no interruption during the uploads. 

S| It's really no big deal to me, but is worth mentioning. 

S| All in all, the good far outweighs the bad.

S| What was the biggest must-have item of 2004?

S| Yep, the iPod. 

S|Sales of Apple's mini-phenomenon currently stand at around 20 million worldwide, and this number is set to triple over the next couple of years.

S| But is it worth all the hype? 

S|Well reviewing a product like this is definitely complicated, because do I rate my personal connotation on it? 

S|Or simply rate its performance in relation to other products? 

S|There's no two ways about it, I have been less than impressed with my own iPod 20 GB when it arrived two weeks ago.

S| However, having said that, this could just be because I haven't really had enough time to experience it in its entirety.  

S|I rarely get drawn in by mass-commercialism, but something about the iPod made me say, in the words of Lou and Andy, "I WANT THAT ONE!" I was willing to shell out
