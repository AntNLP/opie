S|Back in May 2004, when I first reviewed this, it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run.
A|T|17|18|install

S|Since then, I have had one problem after another.

S|To say that it is "buggy" would be the world's most profound understatement.

S|Almost from the beginning, LiveUpdate would not function.

A|O|2|3|failed
A|T|7|8|updates

S|When I finally got it working, it only worked properly for many a month.

S|The next problem was that it didn't recognize all the installed components, so it would not update them, most notably and importantly, virus definitions.
A|T|11|12|components
A|O|2|3|problem
A|R|O|2|3|problem|T|11|12|components

S|Without this important feature, both SystemWorks and Internet Security are all but useless.

S|Without updated virus definiations, your PC is also at serious risk!

S|Once installed, however, some of the functions do work OK (Disk Doctor, One Button Checkup, and WinDoctor).

S|The other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of Norton SystemWorks before you installs this.

S|Warning! The Windows "remove program" feature does not do a good job of this, and neither does Norton's own removal program.

S|A lot of "fragments" were left in the Registry, and it the Norton system folders.

S|Their website had a download that helped remove those, although I had to manually remove a good number of files from the "Programs" directory.

S|If you have an older version of "Internet Security" installed, you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with SystemWorks install.

S|You also need to go in and MANUALLY remove many Symantec files from the REGISTRY.

S|(Intructions for doing so are on Symantecs website.)

S|Even this, however, did not solve my problems.

S|As of October, 2004, these products are NOT working and I'm ready to demand a refund from Symantec.

S|Personally, I may never buy Symantect products again.

S|I had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the Norton firewall vs. the windows firewall, and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because I did not have a "customer priority ID number."

S|Then when I went to Norton's website to obtain a priority ID number per the instructions I had been given, I couldn't find a way to get one.

S|So I e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question, and got a reply which was totally unresponsive (it looked as though they didn't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs).

S|And, when you think about it, it's insulting that Norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase, whether on the phone or online (what if your computer is down?), should have equal priority.

S|I may not be a computer expert but I am perfectly capable of following detailed instructions, and Norton just makes life way too hard.

S|Plus, when Norton provided online updates, there were so many unexplained categories (about 15 over and above virus definitions)

S|I originally had bought Norton Internet Security for my laptop after the preinstalled Norton Antivirus trial had finished.

S|The hardest part was the run around with what software suite to buy.

S|This package contains BOTH Norton Antivirus and Firewall.

S|The only reason I'd buy them separately in the combo package is for two liecenses.

S|If you want integrated Antivirus and Firewall this is what I'd suggest.

S|It usually only takes 5-10 MB's of system memory.

S|I just got an older 866 Mhz system with 512 PC 133 RAM and it also runs fine on that.

S|Both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together.
A|O|6|7|integrated
A|T|2|5|antivirus and firewall

S|I have had Norton Internet Security for 3 yrs and up graded to 2004 versionin August 2004.

S|Now in October,2004, the firewall said I couldn't OK anymore software to use the internet because its full.

S|Im at full capacity!!!! I called Symantic and they said they don't know why but I should get Tech's Support at $35/hr to help!! I did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes untill I hung up!

S|I am going to buy PC-cillium ASAP.

S|So, DON'T buy this or upgrade.

S|

S|If you currently own the 2003 version, and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version, don't.

S|There is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedius activation process, and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive.

S|After a recent update, I can no longer open more then 1 browser window.

S|I've searched the program and their online tech support (worthless) and have found no solutions.

S|Again, I tried online email support.

S|They gave me a ridiculous set of steps which included emailing them screen prints as PDF files!

S|I use the program like most other people - in DISABLED mode.

S|Eventually I will uninstall this troublesome bug-filled program.

S|Maybe it's time to explore McAfee products again...

S|

S|Before installing anything on your computer, you need to do a bit of research before spending the money.

S|This is definitely one of those products, especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit.

S|

S|I recommended this for my father based on my experience with previous versions.

S|I wish I'd done some research first....

S|If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.

S|Can't get easier than that!

S|Avoid like the plague.

S|I already knew something was wrong, because much of the Spam I've seen in the past six months was from resellers of Norton products.

S|For Norton to encourage Spammers by letting them sell their products is a very bad sign.

S|

S|Well, I must be one of the few fortunate ones on here.

S|In January of 2004, I renewed my subscription service for NIS 2003 but on Jan 7, everything changed.

S|There was a Verisign problem that conflicted w/Word and Excel and was posted on the Symantec site that affected computers.

S|The Symantec site said it didn't affect NIS but I believe it did.

S|I also believe that when I renewed my subscription service that Symantec uploaded the NIS 2004 patch.

S|All of a sudden everything that reviewers were writing about NIS 2004 was happening to my computer.

S|Booting up my computer took forever!!!

S|Then, my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone.
A|T|2|4|ad/pop-up blocking
A|O|6|7|gone
A|R|O|6|7|gone|T|2|4|ad/pop-up blocking

S|My file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites.

S|After extensive researching on the Symantec site I broke down and called Symantec.

S|Again, every review written about the Tech Line is true...after waiting close to 45 minutes I finally spoke to a rep.

S|I had to pay $29.95 just to go any further.

S|After telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program (which I had already done)...

S|They sent me a link to their website to follow instructions on ridding my registry of all Symantec products so I could get a clean re-install.

S|They didn't know what the problem could be.

S|They said to call back if it still didn't work after the complete uninstall.

S|I did it and it was worse the second time around...unbelievable.

S|I gave up.

S|Basically, I ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the Tech Help.

S|

S|NIS is a package of several Norton products.

S|Unfortunately, it does not give you the option of unstalling (or uninstalling) them individually.
A|R|O|0|1|Unfortunately|T|9|10|unstalling
A|T|9|10|unstalling
A|O|0|1|Unfortunately

S|If you get NIS be sure you want ALL of them installed and running on your machine.

S|You can "disable" some of the individual components, but don't be fooled--they're still there and running.

S|Although I disabled Norton AntiSpam, it is still there.

S|Every time I start Eudora, a message from AntiSpam pops up telling me that COM automation needs to be turned on for it to run properly.

S|I guess the possibility that someone might not want it to run at all never occured to the designers.

S|Just to try to shut it up, I told it to go ahead and turn on COM automation.

S|This did manage to cut the number of popups during start-up from 4 down to 2.

S|But those 2 come up every time.

S|And this despite the fact that I'm not even using AntiSpam.

S|Next, the big reason not to buy ANY Norton product:  If there's a problem with it, Norton charges $30 to even tell them about it.
A|T|8|10|Norton product

S|Sure they say if it's their fault you won't get charged, but THEY are the ones who get to decide whether it's their fault.

S|And you have to put up the 30 bucks to get them to decide.

S|Nice little racket they've got there.

S|

S|I bought Norton Internet Security years ago when it first came out.

S|While it didn't have all the features I would have liked, it was better than anything else I could find at the time.

S|I tried to call Norton, and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for Non-tech Customer Service (tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of MUZAC) or they have a $30 tech-support number.

S|Who wants to pay $30 to discuss a defect in a product that just cost $95? (I also bought the back-up CD).

S|I finally got a free support number for Norton through my ISP support staff, but waited an hour or more for a voice.

S|They said they would refund all the money, but a month later, they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to "handle" and ship a CD? --and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails.

S|While I understand the complaints about Symantec's Norton SystemWorks software suite (which are totally justified), the same can't be said for Norton Internet Security.

S|To install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called Symantec or Nortron,... also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted.

S|If you got stuck do what I did,search for any folder called symantec and delete it! then install that program(assuming you know what you are doing).

S|If you have no previous version of  nortron security on your system, or Nortron Antivirus, the installation will go fine, otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up!the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation, even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly.

S|I used "Add/Remove Programs" to unistall NIS 2003.

S|In "Add/Remove, you must selecting the program's Change button.

S|After that was complete, I deleted the Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security folders left in the "Programs" section of Windows XP.

S|Next I de-fragged my hard drive.

S|I did not use the Rnis.exe, since I have WinFax Pro on my system. I did not touch the Windows Registry, for the same reason.

S|So when I reformatted for the third time, downloading SP2 took no time at all and the new XP was kind enough to even suggest other antivirus programs to try (it also listed Norton and McAffee).

S|I downloaded a trial version of Computer Associates EZ Firewall and Antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again.

S|I originally bought McAfee VirusScan 7 from Amazon.

S|About a month ago, it had an error that I could not fix and the program would not update.

S|Even though I had 6+ months left on the McAfee subscription, I decided to move on and buy Norton Internet Security 2004 (NIS).

S|I did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here.

S|I did remove all remnants of McAfee before installing and confirmed the Windows XP firewall was off.

S|It was immediately noticeable that NIS slows down my computer (Pent4, 256 RAM).

S|I think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open/close scanning that it does with every program.

S|Is it necessary to scan my MS Money database when I close the program?

S|I'm not sure how it would have been compromised by a virus.

S|I have a modern PC with lots of speed and memory, but this firewall just brought it to a halt.

S|I just about lost it this morning with this software.

S|While I was trying to play Half Life 2 it started popping up with "alerts" every twenty seconds (literally), warning me my antivirus protection was off.

S|But it wouldn't let me turn the AV protection back on and it wouldn't stop with the alerts.

S|I had tried to uninstall Norton Internet Security a few weeks ago, and it wouldn't let me do that either.

S|I tried it again this morning and it said I didn't have the required "permissions" and lacked proper administrator status.

S|On my own home computer.

S|Of course, if you try to reach Symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident.

S|Finally I ran msconfig and went into the "services" tab and unchecked every last Norton/Symantec "service," then ran uninstall again.

S|This time, it started the uninstallation process, then I left for work. I think it will work. I hope it will work.

S|I simply hate Symantec. I swear, if I could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare, bleeding hands, I would have.
