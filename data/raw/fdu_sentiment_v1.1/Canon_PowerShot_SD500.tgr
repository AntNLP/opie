S|I've had it for about a month and it is simply the best point-and-shoot your money can buy. 

S|I sincerely question the CNET reviewer's ability and/or their bias. 

S|If you want something resembling a REAL and professional review before plunking down your $500.00, I suggest going to dpreview or dcresource and reading the reviews there. 

S|I post under JTL at dcresource...check out my images if you want to see what this camera can do. 

S|I thought given all the "10" reviews about this camera that I would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey.

S|I figured that the few people who reported that the LCD screen cracked on them was episodic and it would never happen to me. 

S|I received the SD500 on Monday, charged the battery and inserted the SD card that came with it, took a few pictures and waited until Thursday when the 2 GB SD card came that I had ordered. 

S|The camera was sitting on my home desk waiting for the new digital card and the weekend for the first round of serious shooting. 

S|It was NOT dropped or sat on or subjected to any other trauma -- it just sat on my desk in my home office Â– where no one goes but me. 

S|When I went to put in the new SD Card I looked at the LCD Screen -- CRACKED-- and the fluid gave a Jackson Pollock type appearance to the screen, black and blue and purple blotches and streaks --useless.

S|And shooters in low light should either select the iso manually and/or make sure that they don't shake much, as the camera's chip goes for detail over smoothness. 

S|Also ensure that the low light focusing LED is pointing at the point you want in focus - and use the focus lock (something the cnet reviewer was obviously not familiar with).

S|I have showed the pictures I have taken to many of my colleagues, alot of whom have expensive dslrs.

S|I can't comment on most of the manual features of the camera because I've been shooting in auto mode, but based on my experience so far, manual adjustment, while available, won't be needed for most of the shots I will be taking. 

S|Once I have the time, I plan to explore all the high end features of the camera, but for now, I can't comment intelligently or fairly. 

S|The only knock I have is that the flash is underpowered.

S|I expected more from a 7MP sensor and a Digic II processor. 

S|Lacking a high speed/sports mode is something I'll never understand in a camera of this caliber and price. 

S|You don't have a shutter or aperture priority mode...so the lack of a high speed program is a total dealbreaker for me.

S|All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time.

S|If you use the LCD wisely and dont use it as a TV screen to show all your buddys the girl you went on a date with last night, you should be able to get plenty of shots in on a charge, I have only seen the warning light once, and that was after a week of daily occasional to medium duty use. 

S|and even after the warning i had enough juice left to finish the evening with.

S|The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can.

S|i forgot to mention about the camera's design. 

S|if you haven't noticed, they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer. 

S|they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self-timer.

S|I bought this camera two days ago, and I'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money.

S|Only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash. 

S|The pictures tend to get blurry due to longer exposure, but his can be disabled in the manual settings. 

S|If you on the other hand always use automatic settings (and not manual) you should be just fine, as the camera features some of the best automatic settings I have ever seen.

S|The SD500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months, and the LCD has been broken twice. 

S|The first time, I paid $165 (excluding shipping) to have it fixed by Canon Service Center. 

S|I am still waiting news as to whether I will be charged for the 2nd time.

S|I would not deny that some cameras are not treated with care. 

S|However, it was not so in my case.

S|$500 may not be a lot of money for some, but it is for me. 

S|Treating my cameras, past and present, with utmost care ensures my investment. 

S|In response to "testing" the LCD through pressure in the center and sides, I am glad that it did not cause any damage. 

S|Otherwise, I would have changed my one-liner to "useless" instead of "flimsy".

S|My SD500 was kept in a case all the time if not being used. 

S|I took it out one day and the LCD was not working.

S|I read all the reviews on cnet, steve's, dpreview and a host of other sites before i decided to buy this camera. 

S|All were generally favorable but i still had my doubts just because their review is based largely on the kind of photography that they do. 

S|I tell you now, after lot of shooting in many different situations, this camera is amazing. 

S|I Was hesitant to rate it a 10 just because it seems so extreme, however I really can't find anything wrong with it.

S|As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen.

S|Highly recommended.

S|As it turns out, this is an awesome camera! 

S|If you want one you better hurry up - supply is low and demand is high which means prices may go way up!

S|The CNET review does not give this camera the review it deserves. 

S|CNET told you not to look for advanced controls. 

S|However, this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes.

S|Sometimes indoor with poor light you can notice small noise. 

S|I had G600(6MP) before this one and I noticed big difference in picture quality and performance using SD500. 

S|If you don't care about manual controls then its for you!

S|Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight. 

S|When the overall image quality (especially natural colours, details, natural looking of the pictures) is the most important thing, then this camera ist top notch and very impressive.

S|In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes). 

S|The Fujifilm F10 is probably the best compact camera for low light (ISO 400 with not much noise, even ISO 800 is relative good).

S|Some adjustments in the settings could help make it better.

S|I found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus, manual mode, ISO 100 (shorter aperture-time, so more often sharper images as with ISO 50), auto white balance (auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras I have and they already do very-well).
