This stain remover worked great to remove stains left behind that other cleaners failed to remove .
Unfortunately one of our cats is a puker
I do n't always catch her in time to get her off the carpet !
This stain remover has removed each and every stain she has left behind !
Even some she was n't responsible for .
It does have a strong perfumy smell to it , not unpleasant , but strong .
