This ballistic pad had a questionable start when my 9 month old dobe went to town on it as soon as it was placed in his crate .
I did n't hold any hope for it while I was at work .
Well to my surprise , when I got home the pad looked brand new .
It 's going on two weeks now and not one rip .
I 'm getting another dobe in two weeks and I most definitely will get another one these for her crate .
