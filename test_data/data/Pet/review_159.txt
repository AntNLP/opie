I was able to get built up stains out of a carpet in my house .
I followed the instructions
spray heavily
let sit 1 hour
blot dry and repeated the same about 3 times and the area looks 100 % better .
I will also try the spray heavily
use brush
let sit and then blot dry method on a different area to see how well that works .
The smell on the area has also improved a lot since using the product .
I would recommend to anyone needing to clean any type of pet stain .
