We love this bed !
Our American bulldog/boxer rescue has separation anxiety and has destroyed not only 3 kennels but also 5 beds .
We were at our wits end .
We found this company and decided to give it a try .
We 've had it for a almost a month now and she loves it ...
but most importantly she has n't destroyed it .
Thank you K9 ballistics !
