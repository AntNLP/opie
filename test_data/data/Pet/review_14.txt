My dog -LRB- a 15 lb poodle mix -RRB- has destroyed no fewer than four beds in her 9 months of existence .
After buying the most chewproof bed available at Petsmart and coming home one day to a floor full of stuffing
I was fed up .
We have had the TUFF bed crate pad for about 2 months now and she has n't been able to make the tiniest hole in it .
Of course she ripped the tag off the first day ,
but she has n't been able to tear the actual fabric at all .
I wish I had bought this bed from the beginning and I could have saved so much money on dog beds .
When I get another puppy , I will definitely buy another one of these beds !
