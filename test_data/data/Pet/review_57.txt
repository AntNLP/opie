I have had tons of these for months .
They have big cute faces , can get rather large .
Just had babies a couple months ago and some are larger then a golf ball .
Now mine did mate with an Apple Snail , so who knows what my bigger one is .
None of mine have ever eaten my plants , with the exception of my Crystalwort .
They know when I feed my frogs and come running at dinner time .
They will eat debris and algae on plants but you will not see damage .
