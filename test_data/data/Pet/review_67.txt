I owe two rescue dogs n thought these bones would be perfect for them ... n they are .
It 's funny how they have decided which one each one wants to eat on
very happy with their response .
No mess or bone chips around .
Came very quickly n in a sealed bag with label .
These bones are great as they are from non killed animals n in the USA .
Better than rawhide n great for teeth n breath .
Will purchase again
