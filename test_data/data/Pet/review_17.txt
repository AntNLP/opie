I gave it a three because my dog Mia chewed a hole in the corner after the first week -LRB- I had plenty of chew toys to keepher busy in her kennel -RRB- .
I also e-mailed a picture showing the hole and the stuffing that was pulled out .
I have yet to hear a response from K9 Ballistic .
I just do n't want the waranty to expire on this pad before they address this .
I was really hoping this would last longer .
I may consider buying another product from them once my dog gets older .
