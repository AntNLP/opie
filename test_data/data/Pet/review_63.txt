Danny is a Jumbo size Newfoundland Dog .
It was difficult to find toys and bones which were big enough and sturdy enough for him to enjoy .
The large elk antler I ordered from Jim Hodges Dog Training came yesterday and Danny is having the best time chewing on it .
I know Jim Hodges
he trained Danny for me and he would only offer the best for all dogs .
