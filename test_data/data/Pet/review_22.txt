Like others I was a bit skeptical that the crate pad would stand up to my GSP puppy
she had shredded everything else we put in her crate .
However , with the replacement warranty I was willing to give it a try .
She is treating her new TUFF bed like a queen mattress now and has been sleeping on it for 3 weeks without even trying to tear it apart .
I am so glad we made the decision to purchase this crate pad .
It really is a great product .
