Greta is a rescue dog and is a very aggressive chewer .
I think is her stress reliever .
She did make a small hole in this bed but is did take her a while .
Customer Service had sent me an email to ask about the product and I had just relied that she did manage to chew a small hole in it .
Before I knew it another bed was on it 's way !
Amazing !
I will hold onto the new one , hoping the chewing phase will pass .
Highly recommend this company !
The bed is very nice quality .
My dog is just a beast !
