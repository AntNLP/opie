I have tried many products in the past as I have 3 dogs and also have adult children that visit with their puppy .
None have really totally cleaned any of the pet stains .
To my amazement , this product worked as it is described .
Not only did it clean pet vomit , urine ,
and feces stains ,
but it also cleaned toddler messes as well !
After allowing the spray to sit for about 5-10 minutes
the stains were removed with very little rubbing with a cloth .
The scent is very clean as well .
After a week , the stains did not return as they often have with other cleaners .
I will definitely keep this product on hand and recommend to others
