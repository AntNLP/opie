Buddy is a big black lab who lives on a big lake on a NWR in NE Montana .
He not only looks great in his golden color but is easy to track as he runs through the woods .
He 's not very traffic savvy -LRB- not much traffic -RRB- so I really like the high visibility of the color .
The design is the same we have used with other labs and works very well .
Highly recommended .
Just note : ALL dog collars turn brown after a roll is the dirt after a swim !
