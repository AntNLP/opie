I needed a bed for a puppy who chewed through a soft crate bed I bought at Target .
I have a Kong crate bed for another dog ... but it received horrible reviews for chewers .
This bed seems tough and has a LOT more filling than the Kong -LRB- is only $ 5 more too -RRB- .
I can tell she is comfortable on it .
She did immediately take of the one loose tag , no problem .
No damage .
There is a sewn on tag with the logo on the bed.
I was worried she would rip that off .
I turned that part upside down facing the bottom of the crate .
I think I found a winner for a curious pup !
