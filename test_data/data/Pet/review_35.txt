To give you a better idea
I have a 4 year
55 lb collie lab mix -LRB- crazy like you would not believe -RRB- she has destroy 2 past beds in a matter of a week .
with the k9 Ballistic she did the same and i was able to hold for 1 month before it got a small rip .
but lasted long enough to get my dog more educated .
Yes this bed took a beating
picture your dog pulling and togging on it every day for 1 month .
it help us and I will strongly recommend then .
