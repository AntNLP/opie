We have a one year old Papillion that can chew through anything .
I ordered one of these crate pads for her and she has not been able to even put a dent in it .
We have already ordered another bigger one for her as well .
Wish we had found these sooner as I have wasted a lot of money on other crate pads that she destroyed in a day .
