We have a 10 month old Black Lab who has been through several crate pads including the Kong Pad which claims its tear proof
It 's not !
The TUFF Bed crate pad has lived up to all of its claims & truly deserves to be praised .
It has been several weeks now and it looks brand new
no damage and believe me he has tried we caught him in the act several times .
Thanks again for an amazing product , I recommend to all if you have a chewer ... .
