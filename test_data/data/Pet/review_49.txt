I received this well packed collar much quicker than I expected .
The collar itself is sturdy
with reflective & # 34
dashes & # 34
in the material .
I really like the neon green , it 's a great pop of color .
I 'm very pleased with this purchase .
To top it off
I read the insert that states the manufacturer of Pawtitas collars donates a portion of his proceeds to no-kill animal shelters .
I really admire that , and wish him every success .
