I stumbled on Pro Vet Choice because I normally buy Kids-N-Pets stain remover but it was out of stock on Amazon .
I like this stain remover better because I think it works better
faster and it certainly smells better .
This really is professional strength stain remover .
I have 6 cats and 2 small dogs and this stuff works like a charm on both old and new stains .
I first used it on a small dark orange spot where one of my cats had thrown up the night before .
I sprayed the mess
let it soak for a few minutes and then used an old dish rag to rub on the stain .
It came right out .
I was very impressed .
When I first started spraying I noticed right away that it didn & # 8217
t have a harsh chemical smell like some stain removers do .
I thought it smelled like citrus but my oldest daughter thought it was more of a minty smell
either way it & # 8217
s nice using a cleaner that doesn & # 8217
t leave behind a chemical smell .
It also removed the odor from a towel that got left outside and one of my dogs peed on .
I just put a little in with the laundry and it came out smelling great !
I will be telling my friends and family how great this stain remover works .
