To start , I have a 1 year old German Shepherd puppy ,
and it has been a struggle to find dog beds/crate pads that can handle her .
I have been through countless beds/crate pads ,
and all of them have made it into the trash at some point !
I did extensive research and read hundreds of product reviews for multiple different brands offering a strong
durable ,
but also nice dog bed/crate pad .
In the end I chose the K9 Ballistics TUFF Bed Crate Pad .
The product arrived folded up in a plastic shipping bag .
At first inspection of the product I thought this was for sure the last one I would have to buy seeing as it is made out of thick ripstop nylon and sewn with heavy duty thread .
The first time I put the bed in my dogs crate was supervised and everything was fine ,
and she seemed to like it .
The next day I left for work , then came back later that day ,
and it was chewed up just like the rest that ended up in the trash !
I still believe this is the best ,
or one of the best made beds available ,
but you should know that it is n't as & # 34
TUFF & # 34
as you might perceive !
One redeeming element of this product is definitely the ripstop nylon because that kept the torn area from becoming larger .
My dog is an average chewer ,
and she had Kong toys with her in the crate ,
and she is also still a puppy .
The problem is her sheer strength
in particular her jaw strength
which results in a brand new tennis ball being popped in less than 30 minutes .
The bed being torn up is the result of my dog being a puppy , smelling something ,
and chewing on it .
That is part of the reason I am giving this product 4 stars rather than 3 is because their product is still great ,
and it will be more evident when my dog is no longer a puppy .
I 'm also giving 4 stars because of the company , their customer service ,
and the fact that they actually live up to their lifetime guarantee !
Once I contacted the company about the torn up bed
they sent me a brand new one with expedited shipping !
It was a painless process !
All I did was provide a picture of the damage
along with my dog hiding behind it because she knew she messed up ,
and that was it .
The replacement is doing as expected now that I have trained her not to mess with the bed .
In conclusion , I DO N'T regret the purchase at all .
I just want others in my situation to be well informed about just how strong , durable ,
and resilient this bed really is !
