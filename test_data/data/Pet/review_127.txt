I love this collar .
It sounds stupid but I think my dog does too .
I would suggest
if you are going to buy this
to measure your dogs neck and buy the collar size for the exact inches that your dogs neck is .
I bought an inch larger because I like his collar to be a little loose .
I come to find out when I got it that the company already compensates for this .
But , I contacted the company and they made it right and quickly refunded my old collar .
All in all , it is very high quality .
It stands out from other collars and you will never find something like this at a chain pet store .
I highly recommend this collar !
