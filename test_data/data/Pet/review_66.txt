I 've bought antlers from Pet Smart before and my dogs ran through them like a rawhide bone .
I got these antlers a few weeks ago and my dogs chew on them all the time and neither one of them have been able to put a dent in them .
The difference in quality is immeasurable so do n't waste your time/money at the store or on the other guy 's antlers .
These are awesome .
