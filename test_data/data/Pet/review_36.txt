This was a huge disappointment .
Bought this and in one night my year old mixed breed puppy chewed a hole completely through the bed in one corner ,
and a second along the edge .
It may say chew resistant but it did n't stop our girl at all .
I spent about 10 minutes cleaning up wet bed stuffing this morning .
