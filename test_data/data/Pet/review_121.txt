I 've been buying the 60 pack for about 6 months ,
but this is about 10 % less cost .
I 'll be getting this next time I order .
Same stuff , just more capsules in the bottle .
I have two large inside/outside dogs who used to suffer horribly most of the year here in central Texas .
This stuff actually works .
I also use the monthly ,
but still need the daily because the dogs pick up new fleas every day from the ground .
This little capsule really does kill all the fleas they pick up outside .
