We have two dogs in our home and on occasion we will have an area to clean up .
We have used various similar products in the past ,
but found the Pro Vet Choice carpet cleaner to be far superior to anything we have used previously .
Spots clean up great and no odor remains .
We will bring this product to attention of all our friends with in-house pets .
Thanks Amazon for making this great carpet cleaner for pets available .
