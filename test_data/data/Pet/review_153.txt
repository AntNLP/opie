This is a great product .
Does what it say's .
I like the smell , not too strong of a smell .
I like the smell compared to other 's I have used before .
Sprayed it on the dog bed 's and it took the odor away .
I 'd recommend buying this if you have multiple pets in you 're house or even if it 's just one pet .
Bonus is the house smells great !
