My dog Maggie loved the taste of these chews and they snap in half perfectly for her size .
The Dried Kelp Plaqueoff [ ... ] is included in each bone and the proper dosing level .
This help with plaque and tarter and helps freshen breath !
No wheat , grain and gluten-free , made in Colorado , USA .
The Bacon flavor is a huge hit and we will be trying the other for flavors soon .
I like their clever Marketing too , as each bag has 13 bones and weighs 17oz .
This trumps the Greenies chews without a fight !
And less cost !
Thanks Indigenous team in Colorado !
Bring us additional flavors when you can please !
