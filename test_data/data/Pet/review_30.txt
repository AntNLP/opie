My 7 month old , 50 lb .
boxer chewed a hole in the pad the first time we left her with it .
I did n't expect the bed to be chew `` proof ' ,
but it does n't come close to living up to the `` TUFF '' bed that it is advertised as .
Plus , once she got the hole in the bed , she had plenty of stuffing to swallow .
If it is supposed to be a pad for dogs that chew ,
and a medium sized dog can chew through it in one sitting
why would you have regular old stuffing in it ?
Also
no reason to even waste time on the replacement warranty when she will just chew through the next one .
