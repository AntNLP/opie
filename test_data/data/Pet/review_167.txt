I am very impressed with this product .
We have two large dogs , a cat ,
and two children in our household so we get our fair share of messes .
When I received this product
I tried it out on a month old stain on our carpet from dog vomit -LRB- chocolate of all things so nothing was taking the stain out -RRB- .
The first treatment took out probably 95 % of the old stain ,
and a day later I followed up again .
I 'm happy to say the stain is practically unnoticeable now ... very impressed and will definitely recommend .
