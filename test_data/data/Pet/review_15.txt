I would recommend this crate pad to any dog owner whose dog destroys their bed/pad .
Just when I thought my Brittany was going to have to forever spend his daytimes on the hard plastic floor of his crate -LRB- he was a bed destroyer !
I came upon the K9 Ballistics TUFF Bed Crate Pad !
After reading the testimonials of satisfied customers
decided to give it a try and WOW - it really is indestructible !
Now , Cooper and I both are VERY happy !
