Our 11-month old Dane has scratched and chewed her way through all sorts of bedding .
The TUFF Bed Crate Pad was our last hope !
One week later - it 's as good as new !
Not a single tear or scratch .
A lesser pad would have been destroyed by now .
The poly-fill of makes the tough fabric seem & # 34 ;
softer & # 34 ;
than it is .
Our little girl is 110 lbs without much fur or fat , so cushioning is important .
The first night , she jumped right into her crate and took to it right away .
Highly recommend !
