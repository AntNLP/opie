I have been impressed with other dentastix so when I saw the new and improved version I was all for it .
I took a minute to find the right bag , small/medium and was good to go .
I did n't know the size was based on horse .
The things are huge for a 14 pound dog .
The small/medium will be good for a dog in the 25 to 40 pound range but not for anything smaller .
I 'm going to try the mini size next and I 'm sure we will do goodProDog likes them .
Teeth are keeping clean .
No doggie breath .
