With 4 dogs running around I definitely needed this !
First time issuing it I think I used too much cause it left almost a soapy feeling on the carpet .
I was pretty shocked at how clean the spot was though !
So I moved onto another spot and used a little less ,
still did a great job on cleaning up old stains !
I 'm not a huge fan on the smell - I think it 's the enzyme ?
As long as it works and hopefully discourages my dogs from making messes I could care less about the enzyme smell !
Overall a great product to use !
