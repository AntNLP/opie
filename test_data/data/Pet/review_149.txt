Had some tough pet odors to deal with and a friend suggested I try this product .
It was amazing !
Took the odors out of my rugs immediately and left a clean -LRB- not chemically -RRB- scent .
An added bonus ... the stains were completely gone !
Put some in the dog-bedding laundry and everything smells fresh .
Great product !
