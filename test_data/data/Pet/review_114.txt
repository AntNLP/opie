Tuffy Jr .
was good , but definitely not indestructible .
It probably lasted 2 days in out house before we had stuffing all over .
Some may think that I should have rated this lower because of that ,
but honestly once my dog hears the squeaker she is out to tear a toy apart .
Lower quality toys last minutes only .
She also loves the hollow shell once all the stuffing is gone -- so we have a flat tufty Jr .
for her to keep on enjoying !
