My hope is too inform everyone who has a dog that loves to chew up their crate pad/ pillow !
My Rhodesian Ridgeback tore up five crate pad/ and or pillow .
I spent a lot of money , I should have just ordered this one !
It 's truly amazing , she is 105 lbs .
and has a big crate but we were able to buy the medium crate pad and it fits perfect !
This is a great product , thank you for making something that will last !
