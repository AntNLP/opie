I love how this smells !
I ca n't even quite pinpoint what the smell is but it 's great .
And it definitely eliminated our pet smells .
One of our dogs has been having an reflux issue and thus throwing up every single night .
I used this on both old stains and new messes .
It actually worked more easily and quickly on the old/dry stain .
It cleaned the new mess to but that required a lot of elbow grease .
It goes against my instinct but next time
I might let the mess dry a bit first before using this as that seems to make it easier .
Good product , will recommend and use again !
