I wish that I could give you a review of the actual Tuffy G3 Alien toy ,
however , I never received it .
I requested an exchange for the correct toy but received the same wrong toy both times .
The toy I received has 4 legs instead of 3 and is only rated 8/10 on the Tuffy scale -LRB- instead of 9/10 for this item -RRB- .
At least Amazon refunded my money .
