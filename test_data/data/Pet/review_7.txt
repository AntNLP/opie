I bought two of these for my Schipperke puppies
one pup has destroyed all my cheapo beds and two dog baskets in short order .
He has not even tried to pull the beds out of the crates -LRB- yet -RRB- .
I am happy that the boys have a comfortable surface to rest on rather than the hard plastic pan in the crates .
Here 's hoping for a long , uneventful life for these pads .
I highly recommend them .
