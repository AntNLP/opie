As I said above could n't ask for anything more
except for maybe do the scrubbing as wellbut
hey maybe in twenty years right .
It did n't mess up my carpet .
I 've used some that made the carpet lighten in that area .
Although you should always test a small hidden area to double check .
There was no smell left over immediately .
It 's been days since I used it and the spot did n't darken or resurface .
There is n't any resurfacing smell either
It is n't like the cleaner is just masking the scent either ,
because the cleaners scent was gone as well .
It definitely makes the entire process a whole lot faster and much easier .
I wish I would have found this last year when we had a litter of pups on the house .
