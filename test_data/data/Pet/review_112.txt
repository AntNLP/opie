Product is fantastic ,
however , I made the mistake of ordering a large when I should have ordered a medium .
This is totally my fault , there is nothing wrong with the product itself .
Also it holds my patches very well .
Again , there is nothing wrong with the product !
I ordered the wrong size .
If you are considering ordering one for your pooch , do it !
I just received the approval for return ,
and ordered the correct size -LRB- medium for my 60 pound german shepherd -RRB- .
