The bed is made of tough material that seems to be pretty resistant to stains and odors -LRB- after about 1 month of evaluation -RRB- .
Our dog seems to like the bed .
Unfortunately , our dog chewed through the cover in the first day .
Over four weeks he has chewed about five holes in the cover and has pulled some of the stuffing out .
I took a picture of the bed and sent it to K9 's warranty email address on Saturday .
On Monday I got notification that my new crate pad has been mailed .
No questions , no hassle about returning the used pad .
A very smooth , quick , and simple process .
So , the pad seems expensive ,
but the warranty basically means you can get two pads for the listed price -LRB- about $ 70 -RRB- which is a very fair price for a good quality pad - an excellent value since our dog eats every bed we give him .
I believe this is the 6th bed -LRB- and countless blankets
towels
etc -RRB- he has destroyed .
