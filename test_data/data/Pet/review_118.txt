Just perfect for our old dog who is sixteen and takes 3 pills a day
two for seizures .
She ca n't wait to get her pill pocket .
So much easier than trying to jam a pill down her throat ,
especially because she takes 1 and 1/4 of the phenobarbital twice a day ,
and 1/4 of those pills is a tiny bit that could easily get lost otherwise .
