Due to an infestation in our yard from feral cats , our house was CRAWLING with fleas .
We have two cats and a rabbit ,
and none of them have ever been outside to even catch fleas ,
so naturally we were horrified to see our animals swarming with them .
Then they moved to the beds .
We 'd tried every home remedy under the sun to get rid of them , to no avail ,
and then my son was born .
The first time one jumped on the baby I flipped the h out and started planning a full-on chemical bombing of the house .
But before we were forced to invest in hazmat suits , I came across this product .
I sprayed it on our mattress first and let it air dry while we drove out of town .
The next night
when we were home
was the first night EVER that I was able to feed my baby in bed and not have to squish fleas the whole time .
After months of misery ,
and threats of just outright moving out of state to my mother 's house until the fleas are gone
we have relief .
BEST FREAKING PRODUCT EVER !
