We have two small dogs .
One who is 12yrs old and one who is only 3.5 months old .
They both LOVE THESE !
And , they will keep them busy chewing for as long as you let them have them .
I have since bought ,
and sent , to a family member who has larger dogs and their dogs had the same reaction .
These are the best thing I have found for my dogs to keep them occupied
help to keep their teeth clean
that do n't have & # 34
unknown & # 34
substances in them .
It 's so nice to have found something that is actually GOOD for your pet .
I will continue to buy these as long as I own a dog - which will be forever !
Thank you Jim Hodges Dog Training for supplying such a perfect chew for our puppies .
