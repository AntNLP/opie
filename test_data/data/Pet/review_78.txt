The collar is cute .
The width , however , was too widefor a small dog , even though i orderedthe small .
The sewing could be a lotbetter .
All in all
if you have an animalwith a thick -LRB- not long & skinny -RRB- neck
this product will look good .
I , on the otherhand , have a baby chihuahua who cannotwear this .
