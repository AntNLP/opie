Even though our mixed breed 80 lb .
pup was able to chew the corner and start chewing a hole in the center of the bed
the company replaced it immediately after submitting a photo !
This time we sprayed the bed with & # 34 ; bitter apple & # 34 ;
and a little white vinegar ,
and so far so good -LRB- its been about 2 weeks -RRB- .
This bed is well made and fits her crate perfectly .
I would definitely buy another one of their products when the need arises in the future .
The customer service and guarantee can not be beat !
