I used to buy the 101 Dalmation pads from the local supermarket .
Those are good pads , but sometimes the store would be out of stock .
Then I found Superpads here on Amazon and I was using those for awhile .
Superpads were a great value at the time ,
but they 've increased their price by quite a bit !
So , I began the search for another source for dog pads .
I decided to try the ones from Oops Pad .
These are okay ,
but the absorbsion material was n't as thick as the 101 Dalmation brand or the Superpads and they 're smaller in size .
I have a small dog so the thin pad was n't too bad .
Forget it if you have a medium to large dog .
The thinner pad and the smaller size almost did n't make up for the cheaper price over the Superpads .
So the search began again .
sigh* BUT , I found these and these are awesome pads !
Very similar to a name brand one you find in pet stores .
They are thick and quilted .
These are just as good if not better than the Superpads
a lot cheaper in price and vendor shipped very quick !
Xing fingers they do n't double their price or the search will begin again ...
