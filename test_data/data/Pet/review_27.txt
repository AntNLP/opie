My 1 year old lab is n't even that serious of a chewer ,
but based on the good reviews I asked for this bed as a gift for his crate .
I figured the extra & # 34
ballistics & # 34
would be safe just in case he wanted to chew .
On the very first day I put it in his crate
after being gone only 1 hour I came home to a giant hole where this company stitches on the & # 34
K9 Ballistics & # 34
logo .
He tried to rip off the stitched logo -LRB- which is a horrible design idea
placing an weak stitched on logo tag -RRB- and by ripping off the stitched logo it allowed him to chew a big hole through it .
By placing that logo on the pad
it crates a major flaw/weak point and is ultimately the downfall of this crate pad design .
I will be taking advantage of the 90 day replacement warranty and keeping it stored away in the closet because I do not want him to eat the insides of this crate pad .
I may put it at the foot of my bed or something instead .
Very disappointed though .
