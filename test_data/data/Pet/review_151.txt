As soon as I received my Pro Vet Choice stain and odor eliminator I rushed to try it .
We have and have had pets that were n't all too successful in the potty training stages .
Needless to say , my carpets were a wreck , stains galore and an odor to boot .
We 've tried other pet products as well as steam cleaning and nothing has helped .
I sprayed the Pro Vet Choice cleaner and was immediately excited about the wonderful smell .
I had to saturate most of the spots because they were older ,
so they obviously went all the way down to the padding .
I followed the instructions and to my surprise
a few days later I still do n't see the stain or smell any of that nasty pet odor that I was so eager to get rid of .
Thank you guys so much for creating this wonderful product !
I would recommend it to anyone looking to get rid of pet stains and odor .
