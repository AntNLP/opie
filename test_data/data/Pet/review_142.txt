I just purchased the Tuff Reversible Throw to use in the back of my Grand Cherokee where my Bloodhound rides .
It is tough
easy to clean and saves the back of my vehicle from stains
hair
etc .
We do Search and Rescue so my dog is almost always dirty after work .
When we get home
I take it out and shake it off and we 're good to go again .
This works great !
