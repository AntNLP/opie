In her two years of life
our sweet shepherd mix has chewed her way through several crate pads and dog beds .
For months
her crate had no cushion because we could n't find one she could n't chew through .
I saw that K9 Ballistics guaranteed that their pad was chew-proof and gave it a try .
It arrived promptly after I placed the order and certainly appeared to be very well made .
The first night , Corey chewed a corner of the pad and pulled out some stuffing .
I contacted the company immediately .
True to their word , they sent a replacement .
It 's been over a month since the replacement arrived and it remains intact
unchewed
in Corey 's crate !
I am thrilled with this product and with the company 's service .
Corey seems pretty satisfied as well.
