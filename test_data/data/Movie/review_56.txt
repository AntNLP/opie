In spite of a number of excellent , well-acted dramatizations , this mini-series seems poorly researched and unbalanced .
The dramatizations of the future leaders in the first world war is appropriate ,
but not Generals MacArthur or Patton .
What was the point of dramatizing Patton 's infamous slapping of shell-shocked soldier who was also suffering from malaria ?
The narration asserts that Roosevelt ordered the Allied invasion of Sicily from far that Stalin rather than Hitler would control Europe .
What happened to the North African campaign ?
Why then was the USA supplying Stalin with equipment ?
Stalin in fact was pleading with the allies to open a second front .
Later the narrator says that in Stalingrad the Russians had a secret weapon - the infamous Russian winter ,
and troops from Siberia , well acclimated to winter fighting .
True - but more so for battle of Moscow which antedated the battle of Stalingrad .
Minor errors can be seen in some of the dramatizations
Hitler 's armband with two black stripes is an SS armband
not used by Hitler
an SS officer carries a cap with Wehrmacht insignia
a Kriegsmarine flag over a concentration camp
Hitler committed suicide sitting on a sofa in his quarters in the bunker
not in an office in uniform .
More irritating is the pointless babble from politicians
former Vice-president Dick Cheney
former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld ,
and former Senator Joe Lieberman .
None of the commentaries , not even from noted Third Reich historian Sir Richard Evans , was necessary .
His knowledge and expertise should have been consulted in the basic planning of what topics should have been covered and to correct the inaccuracies .
It 's a shame .
