I 'm not a big history buff ,
so I could n't tell you how accurate the documentary is ,
but frankly it is far easier to understand and digest than any history class I 've been in .
Its great for people who are interested in history but ca n't quite digest the average documentary .
Besides , its only a three-part show .
You ca n't expect it to cover everything .
