This rendition of the story was just & # 34 ; o.k .
I was a big fan of the books ,
and liked the newer version of Flowers in the Attic .
I had high hopes for this sequel , but it just left out too many things .
Yes , you got the & # 34 ; general idea & # 34 ; of the story ,
but it skipped over so many things that were important .
to the story line .
I think this version would be easy enough to follow if you were familiar with the books ,
because then your mind could fill in all the blanks as you watch .
I wish they would have presented it as a 2 night mini-series instead .
Then , perhaps , they could have expanded the story .
