This movie does not do justice to the book

Petals in the wind & # 34
.
But it made the point clear .
As much as it could be .
I understand that producers try to make the best version into a movie by crowding as much of the book 's important details so that the viewer can understand the concept .
The acting was good .
Not really great but fairly reasonable .
The most talented actor was hardly shown which would be Ellen Burstyn .
These were young actors on their way up and they were good .
Ca n't take away from them their talent .
Some of the parts were almost comical because as I said
they were crammed to close together and caused a little humor in that regard .
But , take my word for it , .
The book is better .
More exciting and you can not sense the confusion the kids had after getting away from their Grandmothers attic .
In the movie they just show that their incestuous desires just suddenly happened .
And brother and sister slept together .
I only gave it 3 stars for the reason that it had been something I had wanted to watch for a while .
But it does not compare to the book .
