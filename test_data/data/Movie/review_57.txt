I disagree from the other two reviews here .
This miniseries is an excellent overview - and that 's the key word - OVERVIEW .
I 'm sure the intended audience are the general , non-expert , people .
If you say it was inaccurate because there were green fields instead of dead grasses or train tracks instead of dust
then you do n't have to see this show ,
but do n't trash it because it is an exemplary piece of journalism .
All the actors resembled their historical counterparts , the actual reasons for the wars were presented correctly ,
and the commentaries were given by an international cast of authorities - not only American ,
but British , German , Japanese , etc .
So it clearly is not a detailed historical thesis ,
but it is a great , entertaining ,
and enjoyable way to learn about your own and the world history .
