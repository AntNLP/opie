My only complaint is that this movie was n't eight times longer .
Next time , Lifetime , please make it a mini-series event .
So many missed opportunities for more poisonings , car crashes , fires , and nervous breakdowns .
As it stands
we have several identical-looking actors -- statuesque blonds with confused faces -- all sleeping with each other 's spouse-siblings .
Also , I do n't want to spoil anything ,
but there 's a magical surprise in grandma Ellen Burstyn 's trunk at the end !
All in all , A++ choice for cocktail drinking and live-tweeting with your catty friends .
