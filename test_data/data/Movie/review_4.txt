I found Lifetime 's Flowers in the Attic pretty dull and lifeless , but WOW !
the sequel was not dull and was so much fun .
There was never a moment I was n't completely involved in the story .
The story does seem rushed at times , but there were so many unexpected twists and turns .
Also
I have to say this movie took the incest story arch from Flowers in the Attic and multiplied it by 10 .
At times I was surprised by the amount of sex it has in it for a lifetime movie .
There was a scene in which Heather Graham confronts her husband while he 's shaving that had me do a double take because I could not believe what I was seeing .
The acting is actually really good by all .
A vast improvement over the first and the movie is just plain CRAZY !
at times .
It whips along and takes no prisoners .
The final 5 minutes has 3 plot developments that were all a surprise to me .
Judging as an intellectual person , this is not a 5 star film ,
but as someone who can enjoy a lurid , gothic , kinky , over the top drama fest .
I loved It .
