Three stars is generous but there were some parts I enjoyed .
I understand the tagline for this documentary has to do with men who became key figures in World War II and how World War I made them into the men they were but World War I was completely brushed aside .
This is not a documentary to learn about history , it 's not even a good overview .
The documentary begins with Hitler and does n't even mention Gavrilo Princip assassinating Franz Ferdinand which was the catalyst for all this in the first place .
There 's no mention of the national tensions between Britain , Germany , Russia , France etc .
that planted the seeds for WWI .
No mention of the Three Cousins or what each side had to lose .
The Russian Revolution was mentioned only once and inaccurately and there 's hardly if any mention of the sinking of the Luisitania which sparked American calls for intervention after wanting to remain neutral .
World War II was better but not much .
One of the two bright spots of this documentary were an okay overview of the peace of 1919 and the conditions that led to World War II .
However it left out the Spanish Civil War which is seen as a precursor to World War II .
The other was the dramatizations which gave the viewer a glimpse into the time and what the key figures were dealing with .
The music was also good .
Obviously it is impossible to include everything in a 30+ year period in a less than 3 hour documentary ,
however more could 've been done to make it more accurate and reflective of what actually happened .
