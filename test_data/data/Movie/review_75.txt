So is everyone a critic ?
Do n't bother reading the mile long review complaining about the films technology .
This was a good documentary ,
and not near as bad as people are making to out to be .
I 'm not a history buff or a film director but I liked the movie and found myself anxious to see each part .
I plan on buying it when it becomes available .
Cheer up folks !
