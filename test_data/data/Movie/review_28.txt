What in the HELL was this ?
I do n't blame the actors- they did n't write this but Cathy was a steel hearted
strong
cynical powerhouse in the books- this character was like a battered housewife .
Horrible !
That is NOT who Cathy was .
So rushed .
So impossible to wrap this book into a 90 minute movie .
So sad- because it would have been a great mini series because the books have such a following .
