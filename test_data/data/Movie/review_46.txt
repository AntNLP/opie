Like others , I was really looking forward to this , but wound up sorely disappointed .
While the narrative was mostly accurate , albeit very cursory , many of the details were not .
For instance
without explicitly saying so
Likewise scenes purporting to show the same battle were in sunny green fields rather than the bitter cold and snow which is the reality .
Still other extremely important personalities were
for the most part
left out - Montgomery comes to mind right away .
I certainly understand that the focus of the mini-series was to give some idea of what the major players were thinking and how they reacted ,
but the liberties taken with the supporting facts and scenes left a whole lot to be desired .
