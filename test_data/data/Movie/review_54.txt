While & # 34
The World Wars & # 34
was macro-ly correct
there were so many mistakes in the presentation
even historical accuracy
this series is a marginally correct historical docudrama .
The first big mistake , in my opinion , was leaving out Eisenhower .
I know , Eisenhower was overshadowed by MacArthur 's supposed genius ,
and Patton 's personality ,
but Eisenhower was in charge of the American army from the African campaigns all the way through Italy when he left to prepare for Operation Overlord
the amphibious attack on France .
Not once was he mentioned .
Bradley , as well , was neglected .
Bradley was the one general who reprimanded Patton for his slapping the war weary soldier
which was shown in this movie and in the movie & # 34
Patton .
Bradley then became the second in charge after Patton was relieved of his command .
Some of the faults
Generals MacArthur and Marshall were shown with the five-star & # 34
General of the Army & # 34
insignia which were n't given until after the conflict was over .
MacArthur wore a tie all of the time .
He rarely wore a tie , especially during WWII .
The series showed MacArthur as a genius while leading the troops in the Pacific
in reality MacArthur was unprepared when the Japanese attacked the Phillipines and committed troops to doom to obtain minimal results
particularly in New Guinea .
Also
the movie also indicated that MacArthur 's planning went from the Phillipines to directly to the landings on & # 34
mainland & # 34
Japan
in fact
we had many more large islands to attack prior to the proposed 'operation Olympic ' which was to be the actual landings on mainland Japan .
Formosa and Okinawa to name two .
While Patton showed remarkable tank skills in France
when he was in charge of troops in Africa
many soldiers died unnecessarily because of his poor leadership .
In the movie & # 34
Patton
& # 34
he did not stop Rommel in his tracks
Rommel out-foxed everyone and only had to pull out of Africa when he lost his supply chain .
Rommel retreated to Italy virtually un-molested with all of his troops and equipment while the allies stood around smoking cigarettes .
The destroyers shown were of the modern type : Guided Missile Destroyers .
When showing paratroopers in the air
you can see C131 's in the background
an airplane that was n't made until the 60's .I suggest to the reader to not waste your time renting this monstrosity .
The acting is terrible
none of the actors represented their characters well
the story is lame and the facts are not complete .
Instead of six hours , this story could be told in 30 minutes .
I learned nothing new
it is definitely not in the same league as & # 34
Band of Brothers & # 34 ;
and & # 34
Saving Private Ryan & # 34
which are by far the most realistic WWII movies available .
