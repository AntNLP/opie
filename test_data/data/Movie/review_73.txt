After watching the History Channels much anticipated three-night miniseries The World Wars and array of thoughts emerge .
For the span of time in which the two world wars occurred
the show emphasizes that the Great War and Second World War in Europe and the Pacific from 1914 to 1945
roughly ran 30 years
includes the interwar activities and the build up of the conflicts that would arise by 1939 as a part of the stretch of time .
The show contained much attraction and material for any viewer to be enticed to watch .
And for history buffs , learners , readers ,
and teachers of the events of the past ,
especially particular areas of the Second World War
one major and interesting observation of the unique format of the program
a blend of documentary
recreation ,
and re-enactment
the show displayed the key leaders of the two wars as larger than life and iconic in stature - Adolf Hitler
Winston Churchill
Benito Mussolini
Joseph Stalin
General George Patton ,
and President Franklin D .
Roosevelt
each in physical appearance in every segment and scene of the show displayed these individuals much like the recent movies recreating superheroes and villains
i.e .
G.I.
Joe , Captain America , and the Avengers .
However
there appeared an imbalance of the representation or mention of other essential leaders from each of the two theatres of the war
western or eastern
Generals Douglas MacArthur
Emperor Hirohito
Hideki Tojo
Dwight D .
Eisenhower , George Marshall ,
and Admirals Chester Nimitz and William Halsey and Isoroku Yamamoto ,
and how the eastern front ,
especially during World War I and World War II may not have been equally represented in scope as the European front
the first world war conflict did stretch across geographical boundaries and impacted colonies in Asia and the Pacific as well and participants and volunteers .
There was indeed much conflict in the Pacific Ocean and the southern most corridors of islands that took more than two years to deter the Japanese imperial military forces by way of strenuous campaigns and unwelcome weather conditions and climates overlooked in the show .
What happened after Midway and Guadalcanal and what happened in the Philippines for forces to eventually move into Iwo Jima
Okinawa ,
and the fateful days of August 6 and 9 , 1945 ?
Beyond the appearance of the leaders that encountered the world on their shoulders
with many film recreations of the first and second world wars
there is bound to be something missing amidst the tremendous pieces of the puzzle of historical events .
One can discuss and debate of the would and could have been ,
but importantly
this part of history is once again being retold so not to be forgotten by new generations and to learn from these pivotal events .
