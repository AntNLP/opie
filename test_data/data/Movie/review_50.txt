The idea of documenting the connections between the two world wars is good .
It was interesting to see WW2 leaders as they were in WW1 .
However there were so many inaccuracies in the WW2 episode that I have trouble buying anything it says it all .
MacArthur was not a 5 star in WW2 .
Patton was not brought back to the front for the Battle of the Bulge .
He did not win the Italy campaign - in fact he was n't even in it .
That was Clark .
Roosevelt did not personally pick battle commanders .
Good grief .
