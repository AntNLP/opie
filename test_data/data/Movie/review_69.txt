I 'm actually pretty disappointed in the mini-series .
It 's very superficial , as if it was lifted from Wikipedia .
There are small inaccuracies
such as showing General MacArthur wearing his 5-star insignia during a 1930 's meeting with FDR
when such a rank was even created until 1944 .
There are omissions
such as ignoring the fact that Patton was wounded on the battlefield during WWI
and glaring inaccuracies
such as suggesting that the Bolshevik partnership of Lenin and Stalin overthrew the Czar -LRB- This is inaccurate for two reasons ... Stalin 's own propaganda suggested he played much more of a key role in support Lenin than he actually did .
Lenin , in fact , did not trust Stalin ... but was willing to use him ... .
the other inaccuracy is that the Bolsheviks did not storm anything and oust the Czar ... there were protests from all over Russia
leading to Czar Nicholas ' ministers and military advisers recommended he abdicate ... which he did
in favor of provisional government that the Bolsheviks actually DID overthrow 8 months later -RRB- ... with the way the series was promoted
I expected something much more detailed and involved .
Needless to say , I 'm disappointed
