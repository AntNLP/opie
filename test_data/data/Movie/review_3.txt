This was not as good as I had hoped for
I thought maybe lifetime would make a movie of every book in the series ,
but it looks like they did great with Flowers in the Attic
then fell short with trying to cram the remaining books of the series into this 2 hour movie
I loved seeing it on television as the series is one of my favorites ,
but had hoped for a bit more .
