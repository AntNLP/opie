I watched the first of this series , flowers in the attic and got totally sucked in .
Then I watched this movie , the second in the series .
It had a lot of drama and underlying suspense .
I really enjoyed all the different dynamics of the characters and how you really started to feel for there love
even tho it was wrong .
Great ending : -RRB-
