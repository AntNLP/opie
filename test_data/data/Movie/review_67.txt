Lots of complaints about minor details in the reviews here , which seem to be missing the point .
I would not have enjoyed this nearly so much ,
or gotten the overall feel of the era
if it had been bogged down with essentially trivial details .
Yes , it 's definitely a streamlining of history ,
but that was exactly what it was intended to be ,
and it stayed true to the sweep of history .
