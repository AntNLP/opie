I had higher hopes for this movie ,
but I do n't think it 's as terrible as everyone makes it out to be .
This is HARD book to make into a movie , same as Flowers .
I did n't like it per say ,
but there are many movies far worse that fans adore -LRB- I 'm not talking about Twilight before anyone thinks that -RRB- .
I have loved the books since I was in middle school -LRB- I 'm 18 now -RRB- .
Personally I think they should have made it a series like HBO did for Game of Thrones .
