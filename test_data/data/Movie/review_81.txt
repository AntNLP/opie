I liked this program , including the actors who were mostly good .
I noted that MacArthur called Patton `` lieutenant '' when he was a lieutenant colonel
which would never have happened .
I also noted that they had some exceptionally distinguished historians including and especially Sir Max Hastings
who is always excellent .
The gimmick in this presentation was to use modern day politicians including Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld ,
and John McCain to tell us what the wars meant .
McCain had an especially prominent role .
Almost all of the politicians used in this series -LRB- except Leon Panetta -RRB- were strong supporters of the Iraq war .
By presenting themselves as sages on the World Wars were they trying to imply that they made the correct calls in Iraq ?
Or am I inferring this when it was never really implied ?
Guess people will have to decide for themselves .
