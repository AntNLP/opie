The movie was a lot different from the book , right from the beginning .
I 'm not convinced it was such a good thing though .
The book is so cleverly written
where the movie though it was okay did n't do the book justice .
I like the cast .
I like the set and costume design .
Even the cinematography was great .
The story was changed though and that is what made the film just alright .
Plus the movie was much more disturbing , and not in a good way as you might think .
I generally go for disturbing .
Not this time though .
I admit , I 'm curious to see how the other books will be adapted .
They did sign on for them all .
Disturbing is what I like , so hopefully the next set of films can get back on track .
