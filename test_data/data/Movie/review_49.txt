Watch the extended version that 's being shown on H2HD at the moment .
Some great insight that was n't mentioned in the version that was aired on Memorial Day weekend .
This series is great in every way .
I 'm an history fanatic ,
and I believe that there are some historical inaccuracies that are mentioned , it really is very entertaining ,
and insightful .
