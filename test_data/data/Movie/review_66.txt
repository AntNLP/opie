I guess I was thinking that something called `` The History Channel '' would at least make an effort to get details correct ,
but that seems to have been far too much to expect .
From the channel that brings us such intellectual fare as `` Ancient Aliens '' and `` Ice Road Truckers '' comes an over-ambitious and under-researched summary of the most important decades of the 20th century filled with mistakes and omissions .
They run the gamut from little things like Gen .
MacArthur having 5 stars on his collar in the 30 's and German soldiers using English rifles ,
and showing B-17s and P-51s when discussing the Battle of Britain
to setting the Beer Hall Putsch & march through the streets in what appears to be an unused railway station and implying that it was FDR who planned the battle of Midway .
Omissions include not even mentioning such minor characters as Generals Eisenhower
Montgomery and Rommel and Admirals Nimitz and Halsey as well as things like the Soviet invasion of Finland ,
and pretty much the bulk of the Pacific theater aside from the Philippines .
There are a plethora of others , far too many to recount ,
but they simply show that the producers were far more concerned with the `` look '' than the `` facts '' .
The problem is almost all of these could have been corrected with a modicum of effort ,
but that was
apparently
not in the budget after paying someone like Donald Rumsfeld to give his `` expert '' opinion on Hitler .
I am also sure the ghost of FDR will rest easier knowing that Dick Cheney spoke glowingly of his leadership during the crisis .
