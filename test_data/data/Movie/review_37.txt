This film was great .
I did n't like the actress who was cast as & # 34
Cathy & # 34
,
but all-in-all , this was a great movie .
Ellen Burstyn is perfect .
This is n't a film for the children , although .
There are some rather gratuitously sexual scenes .
The whole & # 34 ; incest & # 34 ; thing is enough to gag a maggot ,
however , it truly makes you feel anger for these characters .
The only real & # 34
good guy & # 34
in this film
is the Grandmother .
She 's the only one you do n't really feel disgust for .
