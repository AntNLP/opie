Of course the book is always better ,
and details have been changed so they could fit the story into a small time frame .
That being said I believe they rely upon the reader to have known the story to really get the depth of the situation .
I did like the movie overall and I am looking forward to if there be thorns ,
and seeds of yesterday .
I am hoping they also come back with the casteel series !
