Petals in The Wind I saw this movie on lifetime last night and saw the first one as well .
I did n't like the way the two older children were acting at all .
Brother & sister , kissing etc.
That is twisted and sick.
I would n't buy either movie .
Once was enough to view these two movies .
Would n't watch them again .
I liked the 1987 version of : 'Flowers in The Attic much better and recommend it.
A much better version.
Which I would view again .
Plus one more thing about the up to date version
the brother & sister getting married & having children together which was towards the end of the second movie was again so sick & twisted .
GARBAGE !
Abnormal behavior for brother & sister .
Do n't waste your money on either of these movies .
