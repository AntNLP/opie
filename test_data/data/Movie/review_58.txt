Although some of this series is very interesting and worth viewing
telling the story of WWI and WWII in such a short amount of time is totally ridiculous and impossible .
Many important facts are left out .
Additionally the technical errors are so drastic that one can not believe anything .
Nothing is mentioned as to the fact that the Japanese at the end of World War I were awarded German island possessions in the Pacific such as the Marshall 's and the Mariana 's
on which thousands of Americans would die in World War II .
The Japanese only joined the Allies in World War I to get these territories on their way to controlling the Pacific .
Take the part concerning the Battle of Britain .
There are gunsight camera views from British planes shooting down German four-engined bombers but the only German four-engined bomber
the Focke-Wulf Condor was hardly ever used over England .
So this footage shows U.S. B-17 's being attacked by German planes
which has nothing to do with the Battle of Britain .
Then there is a view from a German plane bombing England ,
but it is actually a Japanese plane bombing Pearl Harbor .
Finally as the German bombers retreat they are actually American B-17 four-engined Flying Fortresses .
All of the Japanese ships I viewed were modern present-day Japanese warships complete with helicopter hangers and radar domes
which at least should have been made black instead of glaring white .
And on and on -- a really disgusting portrayal of what was .
And what of General Eisenhower and Bradley and Admiral Nimitz and Admiral Halsey and the U.S.
Submarine Service .
Amongst the other important not covered at all is the Home Front and production of weapons in the United States
the Battle of the Atlantic
the Resistance movements in occupied countries .
Not a mention , not a view .
This series should have been
at a minimum have been one week on WWI and the origin of WWII ,
and then two weeks on WWII .
