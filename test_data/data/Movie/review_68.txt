You know how those movies & # 34
based on an actual story & # 34
have that disclaimer at the beginning of the movie ?
Well , it would have been appropriate as a precursor to the so-called History Channel 's presentation .
Entertaining , yes .
Approachable to the casual viewer , yes .
Doubtless some will gain a better knowledge and/or understanding of these events in the context of this presentation .
And it 's not as bad as an Oliver Stone recasting of reality .
On the other hand
is it too much to expect the History Channel to provide an accurate presentation - or at least some acknowledgement that certain events/flow have been presented with a certain & # 34
latitude & # 34
with respect to the actual reality ?
This IS history , after all , and facts are stubborn things ... or should be .
