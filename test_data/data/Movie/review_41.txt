This is the Lifetime sequel to & # 34
Flowers in the Attic & # 34
which left me speechless .
The film picks up a few years later .
Our children managed to survive until Dr .
Paul Sheffield adopted them .
The incestuous siblings pick up where they left off .
Cathy -LRB- Rose McIver -RRB- leaves for NY for ballet .
Christopher -LRB- Wyatt Nash -RRB- is following is adopted father in the medical field and young Carrie -LRB- Bailey Buntain -RRB- has trouble adapting socially to high school and the world in general .
Christopher gets a girlfriend and plans to get married ,
while Cathy is pregnant with a child she claims is her ballet boy friend ,
but who knows .
Mom -LRB- Heather Graham -RRB- makes it back into the film during the second half .
I was scratching my head at the disjointed script and soap opera type drama .
Wyatt Nash reminded me of Casper Van Dien and not in a good way .
The plot twisted in ways I was not prepared for , i.e .
the character has not really been established , especially Cathy who ranged from sweet innocent to demonic devious .
The sexual curiosity of Carrie was done awkwardly if not unintentionally comical .
The bizarreness of the film , kept me watching , like a train wreak .
Please do n't make another one because I will watch it .
I have n't read the book , but it has to be better .
Rated TV-14 for theme and implied sex .
Several scenes of clothes being removed and passionate kissing .
Rose McIver in bra .
