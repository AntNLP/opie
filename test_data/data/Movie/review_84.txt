& # 34
I Do not Want to Go Back Alone & # 34
-LRB- Eu No Quero Voltar Sozinho -RRB- .
It retells the original short 's story while expanding the world in which it takes place is .
The original short was a touching , and heart warming coming of age tale .
The theatrical version stars the same cast with Ghilherme Lobo playing Leo
a blind teen
again his performance is exceptional and the expanded details of his family and school life help set it apart from just a retelling of the short .
Leo 's best friend
Giovana
played by Tess Amorim
is something of an unrequited love and some what frustrated that Leo is quite literally blind to her affections .
When a transfer student
Gabriel
played by Fabio Audi
arrives Giovana and several other girls from Leo 's school find themselves biding for Gabriel 's attention .
All the while Leo continues to deal with bullies
his over protective mother
as well as his own developing friendship with Gabriel .
It 's a touching and well plotted coming of age
as well as coming out story that will just melt your heart .
