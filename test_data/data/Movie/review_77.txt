I enjoyed this entire series and I do feel its ' worth watching .
But the viewer has to go into it knowing that 's its value is in the broad overview of how World War 1 shaped the people and nations involved in World War 2 .
You can not watch this for the small details and expect to learn anything because many of the small details are just flat out wrong .
General Eisenhower is almost completely left out of the entire thing .
That 's inexcusable .
Admiral Yamamoto of Japan
teh guy who planned the Pearl Harbor attacks and adamently argued with his government that it was a bad idea is 100 % left out of this 3 part series without so much as his name being mentioned once .
That 's just insane .
He was a major figure of the war and he does n't exist in this documentary .
Also there is no mention of how hard the US worked to hide Roosevelt 's paralysis .
They went to extreme efforts to make him look perfectly fine so he did n't appear weak to the Axis Powers .
That 's not mentioned once .
They barely mention his polio and paralysis at all .
And World War 1 was sparked when Archduke Ferdinand was shot .
decades of warfare where hundreds of millions died all sparked by the assasination of Ferdinand .
You 'd think they would have mentioned his name .
But nope .
Then they start taking liberties with facts .
For instance Adolf Hitler had a dorky looking mustach .
That 's a fact .
Hitler was also in a gas attack in trenched in World War 1 .
That 's a fact .
But this series connects those two facts and makes it look like Hitler 's inability to get his gas mask sealed in World War 1 caused him to immediately shave the handlebars off his mustashe
giving him his goofy looking famous mustashe right there in the WWI trenches .
I 've never seen any suggestion that happened anywhere .
It was neat in a dramatic sense , but not a historical one .
It also says that the United States was pulled into World War 1 when a plan by the Germans to fund the war with Mexico to keep the US occupied backfired due to the American people finding out about the plan .
That 's all well and good and is factually documented ,
but that was more of a broad call to war .
The overt act that had Americans demanding intervetion into the war was the sinking of Lusitania by a German U-Boat .
I do n't think that was mentioned .
If it was , the Lusitania was n't mentioned by name .
And U-Boats do n't come up at all .
Where this series shines is showing the higher level look at how the events of World War 1 shaped the way World War 2 played out .
It does n't tell you much -LRB- at least not accurately -RRB- about Hitler the man .
But it shows very well how the conditions in Germany allowed the Nazi party to rise to power and how similar conditions could lead to similar results again elsewhere in the world .
It does the same thing for other events in the wars as well ,
but at that `` Concept '' level .
Not the `` Detail '' level .
To some extent I understand leaving some things out .
It 's a 4 and a half our series -LRB- without commercials -RRB- to document what happened on 3 continents over a 30 year span .
It ca n't possible include everything .
So I get that it ca n't go into detail on things like how Hitler when from not being anti-semetic in his youth to redefining the very meaning of anti-semetism in his later years .
That one thing is a 3 hours documentary in itself -LRB- and a VERY interesting one -RRB- But it ca n't be develd into in a broad overview like this one .
There are a hundred things like this that are truncated from this series and I totally understand those kind of omissions .
But omitting major characters like Yamamoto and Eisenhower ?
And getting the details they do include about everyone else wrong ?
It 's inexcusable .
And U-Boats .
Not a single mention of U-Boats .
The powerhouse of the German Navy ... .
not even mentioned .
I did think they did a great job of showing what a sniveling little coward Neville Chamberlain was .
And how a policy of appeasement will always cost you more in the long run .
Overall it 's worth watching .
But do n't put a lot of stock in the details .
Watch it for the larger picture .
