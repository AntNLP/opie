I absolutely enjoyed this movie , I loved it !
I have watched it four times in 6 days .
The only thing I wished had changed about this movie id I wish it was longer or they had divided it up into two movies .
I am excited to see If there be thorns and seedsof yesterday
I hope to see Rose McIver and Wyatt Nash together again on screen
they did an amazing job .
They couldnt have cast a better Cathy and Christopher , the chemistry between them was amazing .
I do wish they had shown more of Cathy and Christopher together
it is such a sick and twisted romantic love story
this movie is a must see !
