I saw this at a film festival and it is easily the best LGBT movie I 've ever seen .
I felt like sexuality was not the star of the movie ,
but instead these great actors portrayed growing up
striving for independence and struggling with disability and sexuality was a component of these things
like they are for any given adolescent .
It was amazing and I would definitely watch it again .
