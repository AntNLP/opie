Seeds of Yesterday & # 34 ;
and the prequel , & # 34 ; Gardens of the Shadows .
Petals on the Wind & # 34 ; is the second book .
The movie is not exactly like the book , but close enough .
The book & # 34

, picks up from where the children leave the attic and the family home.
The movie begins 10 years after the children leave the attic .
The movie is about 3 children

Carrie
who escaped from a horrible situation .
Cathy , the dancer is strong , forceful and determined to get justice .

They find a better life and careers at the home of a caring stranger ,
but they can never forget the past .
They fight forbidden feelings , guilt , deep anger and unending pain .

The movie had action , lust , hate and revenge .
The movie does contain SEXUAL situations between blood relatives .
The movie is rushed and chapters of the book are skipped in order to make the 2 hour timeline ,
but I liked it & # 34 ;
