Ive read the entire series and when i saw they had made a movie esp of this book i was all gung ho but they change too much they totally cut out the Catherine/ Paul relationship and change allot about the Cat/Julian .
and down played her career all together .
the only people that i could see watching this are those who have read the books and i say to you do n't your going to be disappointed
