I watched Flowers in the Attic on television , but could n't Petals on the Wind .
I 'm kinda glad that I bought it .
It 's not bad .
Heather Graham goes a little overboard on the scene chewing ,
but let 's be honest it 's Kathy 's story .
The actors that portrayed the three remaining kids were great .
