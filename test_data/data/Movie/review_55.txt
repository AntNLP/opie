Way too many minutes showing Hitler trimming his moustache .
We all know how he ends up looking i.e .
DORKAMUNDO as Fonzie would say .
It appears to be a weird young/old Hitler
Churchill
FDR
Patton and MacArthur exercise but the Patton and MacArthur segments really perk up the series .
It 's great how they and Churchill prepped for the return of war since they were firmly convinced of Germany 's & # 34
I 'll be back nature .
What he represents is everybody else in Germany who went Nahtzee on the rest of the world and this series like everything else from History/Discovery/Military/American Hero channel hints that Hitler was just a frontman for the real power in Germany behind both world wars .
By using these individuals from different countries to tell the story
the series is able to bring up issues like the fact that America was distracted by war with Mexico and coincidentally
we were finally brought into war with the discovery of the Zimmerman telegram wherein Germany offers Mexico help in taking back territory such as ... Texas .
Bearing in mind that in 1915
Germany was mentoring the Ottoman Turks re the Armenian Genocide and that Turkey with Germany formed the Central Powers .
So maybe getting caught redhanded assassinating their own Habsburg royal to start WW1 spurred the real masterminds to use an actor who found himself after WW1 directed by government to infiltrate the Workers Party .
It all looks like a huge set up to get out of the Versailles Treaty and rearm and rewage war after the ceasefire of WW1 .
