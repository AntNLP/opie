It 's the sequel to Flowers in the Attic ,
so if you have n't watched that yet you must .
The children are grown up and living a life outside the attic as normal as can be until their adopted parent dies .
Problems in the children's/young adults lives start to arise that bring them back to their mother .
What do they seek from their mother ?
Revenge or answers ?
I wo n't tell you , but it 's worth finding out .
I could n't stop watching this movie which is what lead me to give it a rating of 5 stars .
I liked how dramatic it is , but I do n't like the sibling scenes .
I would recommend this to anyone over the age of 16 who likes twisted stories or movies with a gorgeous cast .
Almost too gorgeous ...
