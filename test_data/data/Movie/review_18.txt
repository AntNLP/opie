Stars for Lovers of Bad Movies or Fans of The Books2 Stars for Everyone ElseEarlier this year
the Lifetime network premiered a new interpretation of the 1979 cult novel `` Flowers in the Attic '' by V.C.
Andrews featuring Heather Graham , Mad Men 's Kiernan Shipka , and the incomparable Ellen Burstyn .
While I appreciated that this adaptation tried to stay truer to the source novel than the previous film version
it lacked a bit of suspense for my taste .
Aside from Burstyn
the entire production was missing a bite and energy which left a certain blandness in its wake .
Maybe they tried to be too reverent to the plotting and lost track of how the piece should make you feel -LRB- unsettled and uncomfortable -RRB- .
For good or bad
Lifetime has committed to bringing the novel 's sequels to the air as well .
I think it 's fair to say that `` Petals on the Wind '' is not a particularly good movie ,
but at least it 's a lot more lunatic fun than its predecessor .
As the movie zips along with cartoon villainy , elaborate revenge schemes ,
and a truly Gothic horror finale
I found the movie entirely entertaining if you can embrace its bad movie mojo .
Petals on the Wind '' picks up ten years later than the events of the previous movie .
Cathy , Christopher and Carrie are still haunted by their days in the attic .
Cathy -LRB- now played by Rose McIver -RRB- is an aspiring ballerina
Christopher -LRB- Wyatt Nash -RRB- is a medical student ,
and Carrie -LRB- Bailey Buntain -RRB- is a tormented high school student .
Their adopted father and benefactor has recently died , and they face a brave new world as adults .
As they struggle with their new destiny , the life they left behind is never far from memory .
As both of the older siblings attempt grown-up relationships -LRB- while struggling with the lingering attraction for one another -RRB-
the screenplay races through a number of twists and turns .
Cathy 's trip to New York to be a prima ballerina
for example
is so rushed as to be almost laughable .
Strangely enough , though , that is part of the movie 's charm .
At the shocking end of this particular storyline -LRB- on the opening night of a rather lackluster Romeo and Juliet -RRB-
I simply had to laugh out loud .
It was all so spectacularly silly , but I do n't want to spoil any of its pleasures .
Of course , what we are all waiting for is the final showdown between mother and children .
Graham spends the entire movie renovating the family home while Burstyn is mostly absent -LRB- and
sadly
she is missed -RRB- .
After some more plotting and machinations
the kids force a confrontation at an elaborate party that embraces a delightful lunacy that I loved .
As I mentioned
`` Petals on the Wind '' is never particularly good -LRB- the performances and dialogue can be stilted and painful -RRB- but it is loopy enough to be enjoyable .
Burstyn shines in her brief appearance and even the wooden Heather Graham has some nice moments at the end .
I credit this adaptation for just going for it and embracing its madness .
I laughed along with `` Petals on the Wind '' and , for me , that was enough .
I did n't find it shocking or moving , I found it spirited ,
somewhat twisted ,
and a lot of fun .
KGHarris , 5/14 .
