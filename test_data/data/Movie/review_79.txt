First of all I teach US History at the Jr High and High School level so I know quite a bit on these topics ,
and I believe this three part series is very good and I would recommend giving it a look .
Sure it leaves out many famous important characters from World War II -LRB- in particular the much mentioned Dwight David Eisenhower from comments above -RRB- ,
but the video series was not intended to be an all inclusive account of the war .
Instead this video series chooses to discuss a handful of famous individuals that had connections to the two world wars
both as simple soldiers
future generals ,
and world leaders .
I gave this video series 4/5 stars since as many have said above
it does skip certain details that might lead one to fill in the blanks
like the tank invention ,
but it never says the US invented it -LRB- this is just jumping to an incorrect conclusion -RRB- .
The style in which the series was created tells the stories of these men and is not meant to be full of history lesson details of the entire war
for what it is designed to do it does very well and it is very interesting .
I would recommend it .
