As a former history and anthropology major in college ,
and a detail oriented person I did notice some irritating historical inconsistencies .
Nearly all of the infantry soldiers depicted in combat are armed with British designed Lee-Enfield rifles -LRB- Germans
Americans and Japanese -RRB- .
In the footage detailing The Blitz and the Battle of Britain
German combat camera footage of German fighters destroying American B-17 's is supposed to represent British fighters destroying German bombers .
I wonder what the WWII vets who served in those B-17 's would think of being Nazi stand-ins for this documentary .
It just makes me wonder why the researchers would have been so lax in the details when there is plenty of British gun camera footage depicting British pilots shooting down German planes .
The facts as presented in the documentary are the facts as historians understand them and for people that know little about what the World Wars were really about it is a valuable series .
