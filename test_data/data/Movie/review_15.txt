This is the 2nd in a series of movies based upon the V.C.
Andrews books about the Doppleganger family .
The trailer of this movie gave away TOO much information - it was very long and covered about every dramatic detail of the movie so that kind of spoiled the movie just a bit .
Another thing ... if you have n't read the book
be aware that this story involves an incestual relationship between the two main characters .
It could n't be left out as this relationship is a huge part of the entire series of books .
If you have younger folks watching this
I 'd suggest a discussion before and afterwards just to make sure they understand what is happening .
The Lifetime network has released a teaser promising movies following this one based on the next two books in the series -If There Be Thorns and Seeds of Yesterday .
I 'm looking forward to watching those two as well !
