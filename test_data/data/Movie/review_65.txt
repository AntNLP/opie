I think most of the negative reviews on here have missed the entire point of this series .
Much like how Fox 's & # 34
Cosmos & # 34
series is introducing science concepts to the non-science general public
this show is introducing history to the non-history general public .
Granted & # 34
Cosmos & # 34
does not play nearly as loose with details and facts
it is also 13 episodes long
compared to 3 parts for this series .
In any event , all of the negative reviews have legitimate points about things that this series missed ,
or things that it got wrong .
I am a big-time military history buff ,
and so I am not trying to argue that this series was accurate .
But what these shows were able to accomplish is that they were able to bring this time period to life in a way that other documentaries can not .
They make you feel as if you are living through the history as it happens
at times it plays like a Hollywood blockbuster .
To me , that is the greatest success of a series like this .
As a history buff
I know how riveting history can be
in my opinion
human history is the greatest story ever told ,
and the World Wars -LRB- combined with the Cold War -RRB- were that story 's climax .
This series has successfully conveyed this sense of intensity and drama to millions of people who otherwise would never have been able to experience it .
While documentaries like & # 34
The World at War & # 34
are unbelievably better with the facts and details
how many non-history people can sit through that kind of show ?
Not many , in my opinion .
Why I liked this series is that it was able to convey the sense of drama and intensity that people like me already know exists in history to people who never thought of history in this way before
it conveys it better than I could ever hope to convey it .
Additionally
Americans are so incredibly ignorant of the First World War
that however inaccurate this series may be at times
this series adequately demonstrates just how important the First World War was
it illustrates how the World Wars were intimately connected and really were just one gigantic war .
If you have friends and family who have told you that they generally do not like history ,
or that it bores them to death , I could n't recommend this series enough .
It is the perfect way to introduce to people a new way of looking at history .
I completely understand that every factual error it has is a legitimate knock against it .
But I think it more than makes up for that with each and every person that formerly disliked history ,
and now decides that maybe they do want to check out a documentary series like & # 34
The World at War & # 34
.
There in lies the true value of a series like this .
