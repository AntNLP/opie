For the people that are complaining
the point was to focus on specific people -LRB- Hitler
Stalin
etc .
which is why some other historical figures were not in the spotlight .
I thought it was well done and I enjoyed Jeremy Renner as the narrator .
Hopefully it makes people research the wars/players and get more information .
I hope no one watching honestly thought that this would encompass everything you need to know about the wars which could n't be done in a 3-night/6-hour miniseries .
For what it is , I enjoyed and look forward to rewatching it .
