It 's just okay ...
I 'm a history teacher and a huge World War !
enthusiast , but I just found the series to be lacking on the production side of things .
The pace was a little slow and it had no reason to be ...
If you 're trying to tell the history of WWII from 1939-1945
things should be flying around with graphics
action
information
key battles
mini-bios
etc .
I was really looking forward to this series and hoped to buy the dvd -LRB- I watched the original broadcasts on the History Channel -RRB- ,
but I 'll only pick this up as a used copy for $ 5 a few years down the road .
