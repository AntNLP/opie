With the exception of a few details , this movie had nothing in common with the book .
The first movie , Flowers in the Attic , was very closer to the book .
So I was very excited to see this one in action .
I figured they would n't be able to fit it all in because sooo much happens in the book ,
but I did n't think they would change THAT MUCH .
I 'm not normally a negative person , but I really did not like this movie at all .
