I just finished watching Petals on the Wind .
I was struck by the universally bad acting and terrible production values .
The film looked low budget even by Lifetime standards .
Yet it was hard to look away .
I remember reading the book many years ago and I was surprised that Lifetime did not shy away from the incest story line .
