I approached this highly promoted series with eager anticipation but ended watching it with disappointment and even disgust .
If what 's told here is all you know about WWII , you 'd think that Gen .
Patton single- handedly won the war in Europe and Gen .
MacArthur did the same in the Pacific .
Most astonishing , and shameful is the fact that Gen .
Dwight Eisenhower is never mentioned !
This is distorted , superficial history with all the depth of a comic book .
There is a need for a concise
popularized visual history of these wars that shaped the world we live in ,
but this is not it .
