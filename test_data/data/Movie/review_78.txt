I could complain about all the technical foul-ups with the dramatizations ,
but that has been around long before History Channel came into existence
Hollywood budgets being what they are .
What I WILL complain about is a documentary that re-writes history .
I 'm not sure if the producers simply did n't have any historians available to consult ,
or if the truth was simply not the story they wanted to tell .
Some of the information is simply distortion caused by the timing of the information .
But , this documentary also provides information that is simply NOT TRUE ,
and not all of it is minor details either .
For instance : Patton did NOT conquer Italy in six weeks .
In fact , Patton did not conquer Italy .
And , the Italian Campaign lasted almost 2 years .
Slapping a soldier in Italy got Patton sidelined from the Italian campaign entirely .
-LRB- The Sicilian campaign was separate from the Italian campaign and was treated separately by most historians and by this documentary .
To watch this show , you would think the US invented the tank ,
and Patton personally introduced armored warfare to the world .
In fact , Britain invented the tank ,
and the US had no tanks in World War 1 other than those lent them by the French -LRB- and perhaps some from the British -RRB- .
To watch this show
the breaking of the Japanese codes was done by FDR 's Washington code breakers and FDR warned the fleet of the impending Midway attack .
Also , the ambush of the Japanese fleet was credited as FDR 's `` bold plan '' .
The HYPO code-breakers that discovered the Japanese plans were in Hawaii and reported to Admiral Nimitz .
Nimitz , Fletcher , and Spruance came up with the plans .
Also , the documentary 's description of the battle is incorrect , misleading ,
and contains false statements like that four of the carriers that attacked Pearl Harbor were destroyed in under 6 minutes .
To watch this show
you would think that MacArthur was in charge of the entire Pacific campaign
except for FDR 's apparent almost direct control at Midway .
To watch this show
you would think that Patton was only put back in the field in order to save US forces at the Bulge .
He was put back in the field right after the D-Day landings
months before the Battle of the Bulge
as soon as his part in the deception plans was over .
The show makes a point of claiming that the only reason Hitler attacked Stalingrad was because it was named after Stalin ,
and that the only reason Stalin defended it was for the same reason .
While
no doubt the name of the town was an incentive to both parties
it was a minor one .
Hitler 's drive to the south was to gain the Caucuses oil fields ,
and he had to take Stalingrad or leave a huge Russian army on his flanks .
The idea of this series was a good one .
Take several key figures in World War 2 ,
and show how their experiences in World War 1 and the intervening depression shaped their lives and through them the World War 2 .
And
it might even be understandable if they omitted important events that did n't involve the figures they chose .
But
it is not understandable when they choose to re-write history in order that the chosen figures are more prominent -LRB- Patton and FDR above -RRB- ,
or come up with crack-pot un-substantiated ideas and present them as fact -LRB- Stalingrad above -RRB- ,
or just plain get the history wrong .
Dramatic license may be acceptable in a movie ,
but it does not belong in a documentary , even one containing dramatizations .
I hope no students use this entertaining bunch of misinformation as the basis of a report .
They 'll likely get a failing grade .
