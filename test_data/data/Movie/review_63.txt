I was quite disappointed in this 3 pt series .
Some of the battle re-enactments were done pretty good ,
but some of the facts they presented were totally ridiculous .
Like in the pt 1 , the disaster at Gallipoli .
Narrator Jeremy Renner , said that the Germans stopped the British at Gallipoli .
Wrong .
It was the Turks , not the Germans .
True , they were German allies , but still Turks .
There were many other wrong facts , but in pt 3 , there were key ones .
FDR did not direct the Battle of Midway from the White House .
He probably received hourly reports , but it was Naval HQ in Hawaii that directed the action .
And when Patton slapped that soldier , it was not FDR who suspended him .
It was Eisenhower , probably on orders from Chief Of Staff , Gen George Marshall .
I 'm quite sure , Pres .
Roosevelt was quite aware of the incident ,
but I 'm also positive that he allowed his military commanders to run their commands as they saw fit .
Instead
they made it look like FDR personally ran the American war effort much like Hitler and Stalin ran theirs .
And speaking of Eisenhower , hardly any mention of him at all .
He was commander in chief of the European theater .
Also said repeatedly how Tojo was loyal to Emperor Hirohito .
Right .
Only when it suited him .
Tojo was only loyal to one thing and that was running Japans war effort .
He and the rest of the Japanese military only told the Emperor what they wanted him to know and kept him in the dark on many things .
In fact the military was ready to overthrow him near the end when they thought he was considering surrendering to the Allies .
History Channel dropped the ball on this one .
They had something good and spoiled it with their silly version of history .
