As a V.C.
Andrews fan , I was actually pretty appalled by how awful this 'adaptation ' was .
Even though it 's been quite a few years since I read the Flowers in the Attic series
I 'm still pretty sure that more than half of what happened in this film did not occur in the books .
This was beyond cheesy and badly acted -LRB- Heather Graham anyone ?
I had zero expectations going into this and after the not much better Flowers in the Attic
I did n't think it could get worse .
I watched this because of boredom and a stupid sense of obligation .
There has n't been an adaptation of Petals on the Wind before so I gave it a chance .
I would n't even call this a guilty pleasure .
It 's just plain bad .
Ellen Burstyne is the only slightly redeemable part of this but her role is minuscule and not worth it in the end .
Just stick to re-reading the books and not sullying those memories ...
