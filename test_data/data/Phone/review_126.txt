Stellar phone for the price .
To break it down
+ screen looks great+ great battery life
so do n't expect miracles -RRB- + feels solid -LRB- does n't feel cheap -RRB- - camera does n't have autofocus .
I did n't think I would mind this ,
but it turns out that the chase quickdeposit app requires an autofocus camera- the headphone output is quieter than expected .
it 's fine for actual headphone use ,
but when I hook it up to my car I usually have to crank my car volume about 2-3x as loud as normal .+/- it runs kitkat .
that opens up a lot of the newest features ,
but it also means that you have limited use of your SD card .
You can google & # 34 ; Kitkat SD card & # 34 ; for more info ,
but it was something I did n't realize when I bought it .
Of course it would be great if the phone had LTE , 4K screen , etc ... .
but for the money it will be tough to beat .
