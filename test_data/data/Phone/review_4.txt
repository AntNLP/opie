From the pictures ,
and the word & # 34
flexible & # 34
, I was convinced that this was one you could flex into place - rather
it 's just a floppy cord .
So
if you want to flex it into a position thinking that it will stick - IT WILL NOT .
It 's just a bendy cord .
Works well , but a bit $ $ for what it is when considering the alternates .
