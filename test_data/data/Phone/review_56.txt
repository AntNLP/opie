It 's a good $ 130 3G-only phone with an outdated processor .
It 's like buying a 2-year old phone that 's being phased out -LRB- samsung S3 or the iPhone 4S -RRB- ...
only it 's been repackaged/remarketed as & # 34
new and for emerging markets & # 34
.
Overall I 'm not a fan or against this phone .
I had it and think it 's good ... for the right person .
Who should buy it
If you need a cheaper unlocked phone for travel or need to buy your teenager an inexpensive smartphone .
Who should not buy it
If you really want a $ 350 unlocked motoX or MotoG but think this is just as good .
It isn't .
The android updates will make your phone slower .
The keyboard also wo n't disappear at times .
