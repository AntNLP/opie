Have Used this Moto E for about a month in Korea ,
and found out Moto E is much better than expected.
I 'm using mostly basic functions of a phone
such as reading short stories
news articles and listening to internet radio under Wifi .
This is definitely a wonder-product for its extreme low price.
Day 1
Moto E looked a littler too much simpler than Sony or Samsung 's products out in the market ,
but is quite fast and smooth.
If you have used Google 's pad before
it would be easier to get used to this phone
I mean the flow of buttons and icons you need to press.
Various free apps were available in android app store to customize the phone for my style .
Surprising performance perhaps comes from its software and hardware optimized and also from not covering the basic android features with manufacturer 's own user interface software's .
Messages either short or long ones did not cause any problem when this phone connected to the operator network in Korea.
I was also satisfied with Amazon 's quick delivery at the time of purchase.
Overall
I am more than pleased with this product and ample information given by Amazon system before my buying decision.
