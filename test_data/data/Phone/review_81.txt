I bought this phone because I wanted a smartphone but did n't want to pay an arm and a leg for the latest and greatest .
This phone fits the bill it has a large ~4in screen that is sharp and bright enough for me .
The battery lasts a long time with moderate use during the day .
The almost stock android interface is great , -LRB- I have a bias against touchwiz -RRB- ,
and it runs fast even when handling multiple applications .
This phone is n't chunky in your hand , in my opinion ,
and I love the colorful matte finish shells you can replace the back with to personalize it .
The only downside to this phone is that internal storage is only 4gb
which is n't much and though you can bring it up to 32gb with a SD card not all apps can be moved to it .
Overall great phone for the price and I would recommend buying it if you want a starter smartphone .
