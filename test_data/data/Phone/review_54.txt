Overall , a fantastic phone for the money .
A great entry level smartphone or backup phone for trips to the beach , camping , etc .
where you 'd not want to risk a more expensive device .
The smaller size , rugged plastic housing ,
and Gorilla Glass screen make it ideal for someone that is looking for a functional smartphone that can take some rough handling .
While the phone has 4GB of storage ,
only 2.2GB are user-accessible for loading applications and data -LRB- the remaining 1.8GB is occupied by the operating system and it 's reserved storage .
The beauty of this phone is that it offers an microSD card slot ,
so by purchasing and installing a 32GB card -LRB- under $ 20 -RRB- you can expand the storage to more than what more expensive phones offer .
The sdcard can be used to store photos , music ,
and many larger applications can be moved to the sdcard to free up the internal storage .
Cons : No NFC support .
No front facing camera .
No flash on rear camera .
Rear camera lens is fixed-focus .Pros : Excellent performance , even with Battery Saver enabled .
Screen is bright and crisp ; auto-brightness functions well .
Large , bright white notification LED .
Exceptional all day -LRB- almost 2 days -RRB- battery life .
Edit : First full charge cycle 100 % to 15 % lasted 1 day 16 hours ,
including 5 hours of screen on time .
SD card slot for expanding storage capacity .
Decent speaker volume and sound quality .
Bootloader is easily unlocked : -RRB-
