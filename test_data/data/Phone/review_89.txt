After we investigated several phones my son settled on this one for his graduation .
He has had it for a week and it works excellent .
It easily and quickly locates and connects to wireless internet and browses fast .
The voice texting and such works very well .
Takes really good pictures and videos .
If it lasts a long time has yet to be seen , but trusting it will .
