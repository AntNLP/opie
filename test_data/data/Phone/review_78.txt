I use this with Straight Talk , awesome phone for the price .
Was a huge upgrade from my old Samsung Galaxy Precedent .
Highly recommend buying a case to go with it .
The first day I had it and dropped it in a parking lot and chipped the edge of the screen .
Micro sim card for those that are wondering .
