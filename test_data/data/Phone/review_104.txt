Its great for the price .
Screen : Very sharpPerformance : Overall very responsive and fast .
Stutters once in a while when you have demanding apps running in the background ,
but that is acceptable given the specs .
I have Nova launcher
bunch of custom notification processes
push email
google sync running at the same time .
It stutters only when i have a bunch of apps open as well .
So i would say , its great .
Camera : Fixed focus .
Very basic .
You did not buy this for its camera .
So dont worry abt it .
Build : Solid feel .
A little heavy but completely acceptable
