This phone is incredible responsive
for this great price is a pretty good deal but I have just one complaint
the rom memory to use install apps and games in the phone is too little
it advertises that it has 4 GB ,
but the real thing is that you just have 2.2 GB to download apps and games .
It is the first phone I have and I did n't know the operating system and the default apps occupied the other 1.8 GB .
It has a micro SD slot that supports a 32 GB SD card ,
but this space can be used just to save documents , photos , videos , etc .
You can not install a 1.4 GB game in this phone because it will leave no space to install other games or apps
I am very pleased with the performance
the camera
the possibility to add more space through a micros SD card to save photos and videos ,
but I would have been great if this phone had a little more ROM space .
