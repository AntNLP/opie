I was very surprised by this motorola smartphone .
A return to origins since almost 15 years ago my first mobile phone was a device from this company .
I recently bought a nokia lumia 630 dual sim who took my partner and since then I needed a dual sim for me
I decided to search the motorola moto E .
I loved the moto G too , but I was looking for something cheaper .
And here it is : motorola moto E : no frills , responsive , immediate ,
Android stock interface and very good build quality .
Managing the two sims and quality of calling is a piece of cake .
The only cons
the memory on board is only 4 GB and not all applications can be moved on SD card .
About the sd card put it before turning on the device otherwise does not make you move the app to SD card after powering on .
According the downside I would say the camera
quite mediocre in comparison to nokia lumia 630 and no autofocus .
However , overall a perfect device .
The battery with 3G and wifi always on
with the two active sim
viber and whats app messages and the highest brightness level lasted me the whole day from morning to evening
with a more moderate use it is possible to get almost three days .
At last I must say that the screen is really very nice and bright .
