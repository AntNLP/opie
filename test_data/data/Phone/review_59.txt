First of all , this is a really cheap phone for the features it has .
It 's pretty fast
feels pretty sturdy but you ca n't expect a high-end phone for the price .
It definitely meets my requirements as I 'm not that much of a smartphone fan .
I 'd say that if you 're a person who has a phone just for calling and a few apps it 's definitely fine .
However
do n't misunderstand my review
it does a lot of other things and it does them pretty fine .
However
if you are planning on getting this for gaming or taking pics this is n't the phone for you .
