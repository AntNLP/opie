I am a & # 34
motoman & # 34
as i put it because i had the old motorola MB300 cell phone but since that went bad had been using all sorts of cheap experimental phones .
then i tried the Moto e .
when it comes to a user friendly smartphone that gives you just about everything that google mobile and the android market offers this Moto e is the phone to buy .
And for the price you cant beat it .
the voice recognition is amazing .
A few of my friends are switching from their smartphones which are far more expensive to this
