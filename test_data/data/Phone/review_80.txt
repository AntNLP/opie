I really like this phone .
I got only the 4gb version ,
but downloaded dooblou Wifi Free and ES File explorer so I have plenty of room .
Add my 2gb mini-sd card and there is plenty of room and plenty more to add on .
I am still waiting for a hard cover , because I am clumsy .
But this is a solid phone .
I would recommend it to anyone .
My wife has an Iphone .
This is my first real smart phone and I think it is great .
Keep up the good work Motorola .
