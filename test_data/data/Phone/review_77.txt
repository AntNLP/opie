For several years I have carried Motorola V3 Razr Flip phone and it just never wore out .
But it did not have the new features of a smartphone .
So a close friend of mine showed me her new Moto E and showed me how it worked .
So I decided to purchase one at my local store .
The instructions that came with the phone were easy to use and in just a few minutes I had the phone up and running just fine .
What I like about this phone:1 - It is much easier to learn than I thought it would be .
Phone is very responsive .
I like the Google Player Music Player -- I use a newly purchased Bluetooth speaker and the songs really sound great !
And I installed Amazon MP3 App from the Playstore which plays my music from the cloud when I am on WiFi or from my SD Card when I am off WiFi .
So far the battery life is very good even when I am on WiFi or Bluetooth .
Low cost phone that meets all my needs for a smartphone .
WiFi is easy to connect
is very strong and has a long range and stays connected without any problems .
The WiFi still worked well in every room that I tried and even a very long distance from the router
it still had a very strong signal .
And I walked outside with the phone quite a ways and the WiFi picked up OK .
Camera works OK and I took a few pictures and emailed them .
The camera I found does an OK job for emailing or posting online .
It is not as high quality as my digital camera .
Still it is a much better phone camera than the one on the old Moto V3 Razr .
Bluetooth - I was able to connect my Bluetooth headset and Bluetooth speaker quickly and easily to this phone .
So I recommend this phone to anyone wanting a low cost phone that has many features .
