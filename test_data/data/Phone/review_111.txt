IT IS A GOOD PHONE BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THESE PHONES COME WITH MICRO SIM CARDS ... .
THIS MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO TRANSFER CONTACTS FROM OLDER PHONES ... ...
I STILL DO N'T HAVE MY CONTACTS IN MY NEW PHONE BECAUSE I AM DOING IT & # 34
ONE BY ONE & # 34
MOTOROLA AND GOOGLE ARE SO SMART THAT THEY FORGET TO THINK OF THE USER
