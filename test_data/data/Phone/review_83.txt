This is a nice phone .
I loved my old motorola ,
but after a few years of abuse , it was time to upgrade to something new .
I use a no-contract service -LRB- Cricket -RRB- so I buy my own phones .
This was a good choice .
It runs on KitKat and is quick and responsive .
I use a fitbit tracker and like the lte bluetooth .
I use mapmyworkout apps and the phone handles this and amazon music player with no worries .
I am a teacher and I have found the catalog of teaching apps work fine as well .
There is no forward camera - big deal .
I am not a 14 year old girl so I do n't see a need for facetime chat or whatever .
There is no flash for the rear camera - again not a huge deal .
I took a couple of photos in low light of my pooch and they came out fine for my purposes .
You control the camera using the screen , swiping up and down to zoom .
Took a bit of practice but the system makes sense .
The camera is no big shakes but it is perfectly good for snapping cute pictures of the dog for mysnapinstafacegram .
com or whatever social media platform you prefer .
It 's comfortable to hold and the display is sharp and responsive .
The speakers are fine but when I listen to music , I usually use earbuds .
The audio processors work quite nicely paired with a decent pair of buds or headphones .
I ordered some bluetooth headphones - it will be interesting to see how they sound .
Battery life is good .
I ran errands all day yesterday ,
and took my morning and evening jobs as well a a leisurely walk with the dog .
I had the bluetooth running the entire day and while on my runs and walks
had amazon music and map my fitness going as well .
I also had the gps on all day .
the battery was still good at the end of the day .
That 's nice .
The battery is internal and not user replaceable .
I hope it lasts a long time or motorola replaces them at a reasonable cost .
Call reliability .
Clear and clean signal around town and on the beach .
My service uses the ATT wireless network and I am getting good signal .
And that , my friends , is what a phone is for .
A very reasonable price for an excellent product .
Does it have the latest bells and whistles ?
Nope .
Is it cutting edge ?
Naah .
Did Motorola make this phone to be these things ?
Not at all .
This is a solid phone with excellent features for a very , very reasonable price .
