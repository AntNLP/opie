I 've only played with the phone a bit -LRB- bought it as a gift for a family member -RRB- ,
so this is n't a comprehensive review ,
but here 's my verdict
the touch interface is responsive
the screen resolution is acceptable
Google Maps runs well
voice search/text is on par with the latest phones ,
and the phone feels solidly built .
I have no input on battery life or durability at this point ,
but I have little doubt my family member will find this to be an impressive
if not completely adequate
first smartphone .
-LRB- This is a three- or four-star phone overall ,
and there are much better phones out there ,
but I think this phone deserves a five-star rating for its value for the money .
