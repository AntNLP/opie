This wonderful unlocked Moto E Phone I am delighted with as for the low price that I paid
it has far surpassed my expectations in a smartphone !
Since I own a HUGE five inch Samsung Galaxy Grand
this phone I find just perfect for travel and it is so easy to hold due to the curved back .
For you the reader
my goal here is to give you everyday and practical uses regarding this phone .
PROS
+ Battery Life - Simply AMAZING - the absolute best battery life of any smartphone or tablet that I have owned !
Since this phone does NOT come with lots of bloatware and useless apps
this helps the memory to run better and the battery last longer !
In fact
I have gotten a day and a half of battery use -LRB- I turn off WiFi when I am off the internet or email etc -RRB- .
However , I run my brightness at 100 % .
So on an average day
I get at least a full day with about 20 percent left -LRB- sometimes more -RRB- and then I charge it overnight .
The very long battery life is what sold me on this phone .
Too many times in the past with phones that have too many bells and whistles
the battery ran out so quickly .
However
this phone lasts me all day until I go to bed when it goes back on it 's charger !
Built in slip proof anti slip -LRB- bumper -RRB- cover - In a sense
the slip proof cover is built into the phone and it so attractive and anti slip on the front and on the back
that I did not need to purchase an additional cover to start using the phone .
However , I have my eye on a book style cover for this phone already !
The back of this phone removes you you can change the color of the back part to a different color etc .+ Screen Resolution - AMAZING !
The colors are vivid and the fonts , icons are very clear .
Even though this is a smaller phone at 4.3 inch screen
when I view pages on the internet
the text is clear and pictures very clear and colorful !
And the screen is so clear that I can read PDF books using Adobe Reader and see the pages without my glasses !
KitKat / Pure Android Experience - Since this has the pure Android with no overlays over it ,
and just the essential apps installed
this is a leaner phone that uses much less memory and battery than the ones that have those overlays and are not straight Android !
This means that KitKat OS runs better and faster also I have found .
I know as I own two Samsung tablets with KitKat that I love ,
but they have bloatware on them , this phone does not -RRB- .
It received the Kit Kat update to 4.4.3 soon after I purchased this phone so it is very up to date and running very smoothly .+ WiFi Connecting/Speed of WiFi - The strongest WiFi yet of any phone that I have owned ,
and I really am serious !
This phone has Very , very fast connect and it keeps the connect .
In fact in the back of my home -LRB- the furthest from my router -RRB-
I still get 4.5 bars of WiFi signal on this phone !
This I tested using my home router and on the go at many hotspots with WiFi .
Other hotspots : No problems at all connecting and staying connected on these .
And I found the speed still high at home with several devices connected at the same time to the router ,
and there is no loss in speed .+ External SD Card Information - Since this phone has an external SD slot
I installed my 32GB SanDisk Micro Class 4 Micro SD card and it installed and has worked just fine on this Moto phone .
Note that some people who own 32GB or higher SD cards with Class 10 have had their phones sometimes give them error message
SD Card unexpectedly removed .
This is NOT the fault of the phone .
As I have researched this extensively
my findings have stated that it because a smartphone or tablet reads a class 4 or Class 6 card better .
However , just some people have this problem with a class 10 card ,
but for me
I stick with the class 4 SD card and have never encountered this problem on this phone or on any phone or tablet that I have used .+ Internet & Webpage & Video Viewing - The Chrome browser does a great job ,
however
I use Maxthon Browser with great internet viewing results and it renders webpages quite fast for me .+ Office Program with the phone - Found it to be OK ,
but I went to the Playstore and installed Docs to Go -LRB- which lets me edit
save
view in MS Office types and also view PDF files -RRB- .
There is also a MS Office App -LRB- free -RRB- in the Playstore .+ Music Player - This phone comes with Google Player installed and I like it OK .
It does play music that is stored on my external SD card nicely and saves new Playlists OK -LRB- and Google Player also plays music from the Cloud -RRB- .
However , let me suggest Rocket Music Player -LRB- free -RRB- from the Playstore .
I like it because my music is on my external SD card and it plays it in playlists or from my folders etc .
I have already created my playlists on it and the sound from this player is superb !
Home Videos - The stock video player is OK and plays MOST home videos ,
however
no lagging ever !
CONS : - The new Adobe Flash is not supported ,
however , I found that archived flash -LRB- which I installed -RRB- gets some online videos to play .
So I downloaded the older archived flash which gives me the ability to view many internet videos -LRB- I use Maxthon Browser and have had good results ,
however , I could not get Amazon videos to play -RRB- .- No flash on the 5MP Camera .
This is a lower end camera
I suggest that you use your regular camera for the best picture taking situations .
However
to test this camera
I took several outdoor shots as well as a few indoor shots -LRB- in bright lighting -RRB- and to my amazement
the pictures looked OK ,
and good enough to email and keep ,
yet I will be taking my regular digital camera for more serious camera shots .
Somewhat Low internal storage -LRB- but not a problem -RRB- .
The good news is that if an App has KitKat standard and it is newer updated app
then it can be move onto the External SD Card .
I was able to move more than half of my installed apps so I still have 1.5GB left on my internal space !
No NFC and NO OTG - This phone will not work with an OTG Adapter with flash drive and other USB devices .
This is not a problem as I use Dropbox for sending pictures , etc .
No NFC -LRB- Near Field Communication -RRB- - I do not use this so this is not a problem for me .
Bottom line : Would I buy this Moto E phone over again ?
Yes
I certainly would buy this phone again because it is easy to use
SUPERB battery life
as well as simple to operate .
If you are looking for a easy to use and low cost Android smartphone that has really great battery life
let me suggest this phone to you .
Also ,
since I am a techie person
I will be happy to answer any questions you may have through the comment section .
