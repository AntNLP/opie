Piece of crap .
They do n't bother to tell you before you buy that the battery ca n't be replaced unless they do it
for that kind of fascism
I could have bought an iphone .
Also
out of the box the screen did n't work - there 's a defect so that there 's a line across the screen and some of the colors do n't work .
So I went online with their support for nearly an hour ,
and they treated this as a software problem when it 's really a hardware problem .
They eventually offered to replace it but I 'm out of the USA and wo n't be back for a while
I specifically bought this phone b/c it 's unlocked so that I can use it overseas .
So for now I 'm stuck with a phone with a defective screen .
When I asked them why I could n't see my contacts that are on my SIM card from my old phone
they hung up on me .
I then tried to move some music from my computer onto the phone .
I moved it to the memory card I inserted in the phone ,
but when I went to play the music , the phone did n't know it was there .
And when I plugged the phone back into my computer , the computer would n't recognize the phone .
So I got to waste more time with someone who could n't help me
after 15 minutes they gave me a phone number to call ,
so I got to wait on hold to talk to someone in southeast Asia .
After 21 minutes on hold , they hung up on me ,
and when I called back I was told that their offices were closed .
Seriously ?
It 's some guy in Bangalore where it 's the middle of the night !
Bottom line : piece of crap phone , with crappy support to boot .
Do n't waste your time or money .
