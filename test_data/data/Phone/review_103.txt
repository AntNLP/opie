I 'm very surprised by how speedy this little guy is .
I 'm able to accomplish most tasks with little trouble .
I just pulled it out of the box about six hours ago ,
so I ca n't comment on battery life much .
So far it seems to be on par with my Moto X .
The build quality of the phone is pretty great .
Only thing that I wish was changed a little bit were how the buttons feel .
They are n't wobbly thankfully , but they feel a little mushy .
You do n't get a satisfying click when you press them down .
This phone 's bootloader is unlockable through Motorola 's developer portal ,
so this makes a great toy for those who like to tinker .
Contrary to the official specs , this phone will work with 64 gig micro SD cards .
YMMV , but I was able to pop it in and it worked immediately .
I consider myself a power user and find that
between external and internal storage
I 'm able to comfortably install every app I 'd normally use .
Keep in mind this phone is missing these features
Front facing camera
NFC
LED flash on the backIf you can deal with those missing perks
I can recommend this phone to most anyone that does n't mind not having top of the line gear .
