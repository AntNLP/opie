Now the only grudge I would have against this phone is that it does n't have a flash for the camera ,
and you ca n't insert your own mp3 files for some alert sounds and whatnot .
But from the amount of time I 've had to use this phone
i 'm pleased with it so far .
This is my first smartphone , so I guess I do n't exactly know what to compare to .
However , I do know if a phone works or not .
One thing I definitely like about this phone is its micro SD compatibility .
The Moto G did n't have this option for some strange reason ,
and if your someone to store a lot of stuff on this phone
then you might want to go with this phone rather than the G version .
Now me personally I already had a 4 GB micro SD from my old phone ,
so that upgrade was free : D .
anyways , this phone is also a lot cheaper than the G ,
and in my opinion is a lot better .
This is me ,
so I do n't know what others interests are ,
but I do n't need a phone that ca n't fit in my pocket with some insane 4.5 & # 34
screen .
I like the more smaller phone
that is why this Moto E was the best choice for me .
