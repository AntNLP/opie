I have my main phone -LRB- Samsung Note 2 -RRB- which has all the bells and whistles I ever wanted but it tends to get bogged down by all the crappola-ware by Samsung .
The Moto E makes a perfect 2nd phone for business calls , calendar , email , ...
and GPS !
-LRB- cheaper and more versatile than my Garmin unit -RRB- ... .
plus it 's a little speed demon because it runs so clean .
In a nutshell : Motorola Moto E + Simple Mobile SIM $ 40/mo unlimited = Unbeatable value .
Those people who complain about the specs or lack of advanced features are just missing the point !
