For 129.00 ca n't be beat -LRB- unless the price dropped -RRB- .
The screen is quite good and no `` yellow '' fading in low light scenarios .
One thing is that you NEED to use an SD Card from the START if you want to load a lot of applications .
If insert after the fact it will be hard to move the data/applications over .
In fact the Camera/Video will continue to use the internal memory .
I would recommend everyone get at least an 8GB SD card to avoid the hassle of factory resetting -LRB- because it 's simply faster than editing config files and moving apps one at a time -RRB- .
Cons
Bad Camera -LRB- compared to high end phones -RRB- No LED flashNO LTE Data -LRB- I live on e-mail so no biggie -RRB- .
Small Internal Storage -LRB- buy and SD card even for 10.00 dollars.
it will save you the headache -RRB- THIS WILL NOT WORK with T-Mobile 3G service .
Get the US version .
If you are AT & T ; and/or travel the world this will work .
If you spend most of your time in the US and do n't travel ... .
get the US version -LRB- it works with ATT 3G as well but not overseas 3G -RRB- .
