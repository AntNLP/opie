Bendy .
Sometimes I prefer short cables to avoid clutter and crisscrossing cables .
The problem with short cables is that some of them are stiff which limits how you can position your gadgets .
The bendy is so flexible you can tuck your phone in more ways than a regular cable .
The cable is thicker than most microUSBs available in the market .
The rubbery material also has better grips than plastic .
A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes .
