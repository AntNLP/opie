The advantage comes from its weakness .
The screen size is tiny , and the processor is not of 2014 speed .
However , smaller screen and slower processor consume less power .
The battery keeps going and going .
I 'm currently traveling in Beijing , a huge city with its spiderweb of public transit system .
Moto E 's battery supplies the GPS and mapping tool for me all day long .
It 's global GSM frequency support is also crucial for me .
However
passengers on the subway use smartphones whose screens twice as big as Moto E's .I would definitely recommend this phone to female world travelers .
It fits their palms ,
and has the rounded corners a female would like ,
and has enough battery juice to get the job done .
For male world travelers
we need a 5.0+ inch screen phone with the same battery performance and maybe priced ~200 .
Moto please make one .
