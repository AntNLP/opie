I am extremely happy with my Moto E .
This phone does everything I want and does them well .
Things I was looking for in a new phone
Wanting a small phone was the biggest obstacle I found .
Initially I had written off 4.3 inch screens thinking the phone would be too big but this one is only about 1/4 '' taller and about the same width and thickness as an Iphone 3gs .
That being said it fits VERY comfortably in my pocket .
Also
after researching online a bit I saw that a few people have noted that a 64gb micro sd card works just fine in the Moto E .
I took a chance and bought this one from amazon : http : //www .amazon .com/gp/product/B009QZH6JS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00 ?

=1Once I went into the settings/storage/mount sd card and allowed it to format I had 59.36gb to store my music !
I have it over halfway full now with music and apps and videos and it is working perfectly .
My only gripe is that
as others have noted
the back cover of the phone -LRB- the part you can change for other colors -RRB- has a little bit of wiggle room .
It does not by any means feel like it is going to fall off it is just worth noting .
