This is perfect for the top of my computer .
If charging off of your tower computer
you will need top side USB ports because this cable is not long enough to reach USB ports on the front of any tower computer .
The construction is thick and rubbery solid from end to end .
The ends snap right into place and feel solid .
It looks like this cable can withstand even my neanderthal abuse and keep on rocking .
The cable even seems to dare me to test its limits of abuse .
Best small USB cable I have bought and worth it .
