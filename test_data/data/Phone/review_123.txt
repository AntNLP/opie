Missing a Forward facing camera .
Screen is small compared to most .
I have thrown everything at it , and it 's still quick and responsive .
I have seen no issues running 3D applications , Linux chroots , remote connectivity , video ...
Only thing I can say is nothing has stopped nor bogged this phone down .
Great price , great features , no carrier lock down , no bloat .
