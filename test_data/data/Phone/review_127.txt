I purchased this phone to send to a relative overseas ,
but had a chance to test it for a day or so .
Its hard to imagine any other phone at this price delivering a better user experience .
The screen is vivid , bright , and quite sharp .
The build quality is excellent .
The back of the phone has a smooth , grippy feel usually found on more premium phones .
The screen size is a little on the small side but has the advantage of being easy to use with one hand .
The software and user experience is where this phone really shines .
I prefer to use the pure android kitkat OS running on this MOTO E than a top of the lung Samsung or LG phone running a heavily customized skin of android full of carrier bloat apps .
This phone handles typical smartphone functions like email , calendar , facebook ,
social media ,
and streaming media very smoothly .
Google maps and google now ran smoothly .
The battery life seemed quite good ,
but I did n't use it long enough to make a fair assessment .
As mentioned by other reviewers , the only major drawback I find to this phone is the camera .
I do n't mind the lack of a front facing camera ,
but the lack of flash and the poor quality of the rear facing camera is what would keep me from using this as my daily phone .
If capturing important moments with your phone camera is important to you
the consider paying the $ 50 or so dollars more to jump up to the Moto G which at least offers a flash .
If you 're strapped for cash or do n't plan on using the camera frequently ,
than this is a solid option .
However
given that the Moto G can be had for $ 50 more
I feel that the Moto G offers essentially a no-compromise user experience and would be worth the investment for most users .
Either way you spin it
you 're still paying a fraction of the cost of a premium handset on contract .
