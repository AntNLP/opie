After going to all operators in Seattle downtown looking for a Smartphone running Android for a good price
I found nothing .
This new Moto E I found online is really good and for an excellent price !
For the first time I can recommend getting something other than iPhone .
iPhones are just too expensive .
Previous versions of Android have been painful to use , but it keeps getting better with every release .
This Motorola works really fast , it 's unlocked to any operator -LRB- SIM card not included -RRB- ,
and it is running the latest version of Android and the screen resolution is beautiful .
