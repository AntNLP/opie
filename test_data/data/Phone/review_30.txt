So far so good .
Snug fit and all the soft sided buttons work as they should .
The soft rubber of the cover does make it a little difficult to slide in and out of a back pocket easily ,
but it also wo n't fall out the the pocket either .
Excellent value for the price .
I would n't hesitate to buy another one .
