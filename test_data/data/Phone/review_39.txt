When I saw the price , I just had to buy it .
When I put it in my hand , I was excited of how it fits in my hand .
It is very comfortable .
Screen is good enough , it 's protected by Gorilla Glass .
I think , I can use it for two years .
-LRB- yes , I believe it -RRB- Actually , I did n't find any cons in this phone .
Android running fast , it fits in my hand perfetly and , of course , it calls .
I think , it 's the best phone for this money .
So if you ca n't afford one from this year flagships or you do n't want to buy them - this is a great choice for you .
