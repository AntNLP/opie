Bought this as a gift for my wife -LRB- her first smartphone -RRB- and she is really enjoying it .
With the new way they do phone plans these days it made it really difficult to purchase a $ 650 phone if we did n't have to .
This was a perfect substitute .
Got it for $ 130 , but it does n't feel like a cheapo phone .
It works much better than we expected and seems to be holding up really well -LRB- especially considering we have three little ones that never fail to find our phones no matter how well we hide them -RRB- .
The only negative is the camera .
It takes some decent pictures with good lighting and little movement ,
but we knew this going into the purchase and it is enough for our purposes .
If you need a smartphone that feels high end ,
but do n't want to pay the high end prices , then I recommend this one .
