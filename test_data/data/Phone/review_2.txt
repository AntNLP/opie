I & # 8217
m all for having access to shorter cables like the Lighting and this super-short Bendy Micro USB cable .
I & # 8217
ve got cables all over the place and some of them
like the Bendy
have the micro USB connector and can be used with many
many devices .
The outer jacket of the Bendy is made of a flexible , sturdy silicone .
There are no connections that will eventually bend and break in time .
I have an Apple 30-pin cable I & # 8217 ; m nursing just because of that .
I won & # 8217
t have to get out any electrical tape to doctor up the dCable & # 8217
s Bendy .
The Bendy has built-in versatility and can be used to charge any number of devices ,
including power banks that are used to charge up everything from phones to tablets .
I used the Bendy to do just that .
I plugged it into a power bank , into a wall charger , and into a wall receptacle .
My countertop has a lot less clutter when I use a shorter cable .
Mind you ,
something like the Bendy doesn & # 8217
t work well if you want to plug into say a tower ,
but I & # 8217
m surprised at how many uses I have for this short little critter .
I had no problems with recognition in any device I tried and am quite pleased with the flexibility and versatility of the Bendy .
I would definitely invest in the Bendy cable and would like to see a similar cable with a 30-pin connection for older Apple devices .
