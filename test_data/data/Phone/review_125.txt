When the Moto G came out , it provided killer specs for a low price ,
and there was -LRB- and still there is not -RRB- no competition from other vendors in providing `` best bang for the buck '' phone .
With release of Moto E , it 's clear that company is trying to ride Moto G hype ,
and selling us cheaper phone for greater price than competitors .
The phones with similar specs as Moto E from other vendors , cost around $ 99 .
Right now
CHINESE LENOVO -LRB- Motorola is no longer an U.S. company
Google sold it to lenovo
nothing personal
just business -RRB- is offering us product
equivalent of which can be obtained cheaper from other CHINESE suppliers !
Bottom line : Go for Moto G , while supplies last .
UPDATE : For the price of Moto E , you can get a phone similar to Moto G !
