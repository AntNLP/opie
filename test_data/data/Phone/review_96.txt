Sadly it is a nice phone with software problems .
I have ordered and returned two of them because the earpiece sound did not work .
You could make calls but no one could hear you and you could not hear them .
Motorola had no fix even though it is frequently discussed in their forums .
It is a bit sad .
Do not buy this phone .
