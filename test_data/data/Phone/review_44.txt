This is one of the best values in smartphones .
There are lots of video reviews of this phone on YouTube .
ATT has changed their policy on phone upgrades to require customers to essentially pay full price for phones .
Either your service charges go up or you pay for the phone monthly in the NEXT program .
As a result I began shopping for unlocked phones .
Reviews for the Moto E were good and the price is a tremendous value .
Since Motorola was recently owned by Google
it comes with the latest version of android and does not have any of the annoying add-ons that most phone companies put on their phones .
While this phone does not have 4G LTE capability -LRB- The Moto G does have LTE -RRB- it performs very well and is an ideal phone for the average user .
This was purchased to replace my wife 's feature phone and she really likes it .
Battery life is exceptional even when on wi-fi network .
Recommend purchasing a 32gb micro sd card in order facilitate downloads of music , pics , etc .
