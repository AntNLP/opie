I bought two cables , one black one white .
Color does n't matter unless you 're matching to something .
They work but they do take longer to charge my cell phone .
I have no idea why .
It 's the same desktop computer
not a laptop or tablet I sometimes charge my phone off of instead of the wall .
They are a bit short to even lie a phone on top of the computer when the USB port is 1/3 of the way to the top .
I figured I could lie the phone on top of the tower but can't .
I made a poor decision buying this length and should have measured before .
As they were inexpensive it 's no great loss but I will purchase something else at a place I normally go for phone accessories heavily discounted .
Summed up , I now , I wish had gone for 6 inch or even a little longer .
Woot recommended it at a cheap price with the company name but it then took me to Amazon .
There is n't much you can do with them .
A good Emergency cable but that 's about it .
As I said
they work ok except for length of time it takes to charge
it gives you little room to do much of anything else but charge or connect .
Disappointed and I 'll think twice before making a purchase without measuring again .
It 's my own fault for not planning better .
It 's still good to have if in a pinch .
