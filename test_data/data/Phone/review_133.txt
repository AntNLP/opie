Being on a budget does n't mean having something bad .
It is actually quite good .
Unless you are a power user who loves super quick instant phones
this will be more than enough .
Opening and closing apps is snappy and smooth enough , and they show on the quite beautiful display .
It is bright , and crisp enough for the average person .
I love the micro Sd slot .
It really gives you more memory freedom than most other phones
although it is kind of required in this case as the phone itself only has 4gb of memory .
The speakers are loud enough , and the quality is ok .
The camera is fast , but does n't give good results , mediocre at best .
But it is there and might come in handy now and then .
I would have also liked a front facing camera for skype and stuff ,
but then again it 's not a problem considering the price .
The battery life is simply amazing .
It lasts me all day no problem
wich is actually something many much more expensive phones fail to provide !
The phone comes with a full charger
that means you will need another cable to connect it to your computer .
Browsing is quite smooth , and fast on 3G , and the GPS works well .
Phone is steardy
feels good in your hand -LRB- I love the dimple in the back -RRB-
may seem a little small in terms of screen size ,
but it does it for me .
I love being able to change the back !
The phone never crashed , and did n't fail do acomplish what I desired .
Great phone that does anything you need - but not only that , an amazing price .
You can literally do almost everything here that you could -LRB- or at least anything useful -RRB- on a Galaxy S5 or a nexus 5 without costing a few times less .
I mean who really needs an expensive fancy phone that 's a little snappier or a better camera .
For the price of an iPhone
you could buy in addition to the Moto E a good point and shoot camera ,
some sweet headphones , a watch and still have money to spare ...
I really love the product , it 's my new companion that does everything I need ,
and I do n't have to work a whole year to pay for it .
