The Moto E is really exceptional for the price .
The Moto E feels a lot like its $ 350 older brother , the Moto X .
This phone features the exact design as the Moto X , and feels great in the hands .
Performance is amazing for this price !
there is almost no evident latency .
the biggest problem is the internal storage .
GB is NO WHERE NEAR enough .
really degrades the performance when a lot of the apps im used to using are too big to install ...
I have a youtube review , and an impression video .
