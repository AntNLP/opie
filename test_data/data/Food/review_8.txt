I 've tried one or two other Tumeric Curcumin products ,
and I 'm sure they are fine ,
but this one , upon opening the bottle , looked fresher -LRB- and smelled -RRB- fresher .
It had more of the color I 'd expect from natural Curcumin .
I tried this one as it is organic ,
and about the same price as the others I 've tried .
I try to buy organic foods , so why not buy organic supplements ?
It just makes sense .
There are many peer reviewed studies on the health benefits of Curcumin
which makes this supplement a no-brainer addition to the barrage of supplements I take daily .
Given the number and various types of supplements I take on a daily basis
I ca n't say that any one of them is doing anything specific ,
only that overall , I feel better ,
so I 'll continue taking them all .
In the case of Dr .
Danielle 's Curcumin product -LRB- with bioprene
which greatly enhances absorption -RRB-
I take 6 per day -LRB- 2 with each meal -RRB- ,
and have seen no negative side effects as I finish up my first bottle .
If you 're looking to try a Curcumin supplement , this one is definitely worth a try .
