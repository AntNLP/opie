I first found Love Bean a few years ago at PaleoFX in Austin , TX .
One taste and I was hooked , and I 've been ordering it ever since .
Abso-freaking-lutely the most delicious healthy food you can eat .
You will definitely have to stir it up ,
especially if you receive it in the hot summer months , as the coconut oil separates on top .
I like to stir it all up , get it all mixed in really well ,
and then refrigerate it .
Take a spoonful of it , and it 's like fudge .
Yummm .
