I have been taking it pretty regularly
one pill a day
for the past month or so .
The only benefit I have seen is that I have a regular bowel movement the day I take it which is good for me because I do not go regularly .
So far
my energy level has not gotten better but I will definitely try taking the pills and see if it improves my energy level .
