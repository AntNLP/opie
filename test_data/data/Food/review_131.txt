Generally , we drink brewed coffee .
However
there are times when a cup will do the trick and we want to avoid brewing a pot of coffee ,
especially since we do not use a single-cup brewer .
Taster 's Choice has typically been the instant we use ,
but this coffee seemed like it was worth a shot .
This coffee was instantly loved .
The two people who drink Taster 's Choice in my house both became instant fans of this coffee .
I heard terms like & # 34
high quality
& # 34
& # 34
great taste
& # 34
& # 34
better than Taster 's Choice
& # 34 ;
and & # 34 ; it tastes expensive .
I was somewhat surprised by the praise , mostly because I thought all freeze-dried coffees were similar .
It appears I was terribly wrong .
I should also note that Folger 's instant is another brand we buy ,
and this coffee also beat Folger 's easily .
While the fresh-brewed coffee was the clear winner over the instants
Caf & eacute
Altura Freeze Dried Instant Coffee was a winner among instants .
Please be aware that this coffee is relatively mild .
I believe Caf & eacute ; Altura is coming out with a bolder coffee ,
but in the meantime , try this coffee only if you like a medium or mild roast .
Rarely do I hear a lot of praise for coffee .
I got it the first day we received samples .
This coffee is a tasty keeper if you like instant coffee .
Enjoy !
