Found this first at my local grocery store , then in bulk here on Amazon .
This makes a GREAT base for backpacking dinners .
It is nice & spicy without being overwhelmingly spicy .
I added 1/4 c .
each Ranchers Cut freeze dried scrambled eggs & sausage bits with water .
Brought it all to a boil in a covered pot
took it off the flame
placed the pot in a homemade reflectix pot cozy and 5 minutes later had a hearty & tasty meal .
It would also be great with a variety of freeze-dried or dehydrated beans & veggies -LRB- such as what 's included in the Harmony House Backpacking Kit -RRB- .
