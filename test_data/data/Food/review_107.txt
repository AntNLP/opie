When you use the words freeze dried and instant in the same sentence as coffee
people -LRB- especially here in the US -RRB- usually pull a face ,
or gracefully decline .
The reverse is of course true in Europe , particularly England where it is extremely popular ,
and comes in a huge assortment of brands and flavors .
Apparently , the G .
I 's in WWII who could n't get `` real '' coffee brought it to England during the allied troop days and it caught on ,
and remains popular to this day .
Do n't get too excited , this is not by any means as good as a Keurig ,
or Tassimo French Roast ,
but for a quick ,
and convenient `` cuppa '' it 's ideal .
A lot of freeze dried coffee has that crystalline sparkle ,
and is invariably harsh and bitter , this Cafe Altura not so ,
and in fact testament to that is making it stronger does n't make it bitter -LRB- if you like stronger coffee that is -RRB- Overall it 's a very nice medium bodied roast coffee flavor .
Here 's the problem though ... ... ... ... ... ...
and the reason I only gave four stars - the price is simply outrageous for two 3.5oz jars .
A while back I purchased and reviewedMount Hagen Organic Freeze Dried Instant Coffee
3.53-Ounce Jars -LRB- Pack of 6 -RRB- An exceptional coffee itself and considerably cheaper .
I do n't think instant coffee will ever be a `` big thing '' in the US
we love our real coffee too much ,
but with the craze in one cup and barista machines around
it would be nice to have some variety .
A great example of how much instant coffee lovers are ripped off is the fantastic Kenco MillicanoKenco Millicano Whole Bean Instant Coffee -LRB- 100g -RRB- pricey here in the USA
less than half the cost in Europe .
This IS good instant coffee with a great flavor , it 's just not worth the money .
