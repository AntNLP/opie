I have tried quite a few brands of tumeric curcumin and i think this is the best one of all ... first ... it 's organic.
i do n't want pesticides with my tumeric thank you ... second its more bioavailable so my body receives way more of the supplement.
it is made with integrity and most of all it works !
it helps to reduce my inflammation so that lessens my back pain.
this is a good product and i will keep using it !
