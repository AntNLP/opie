The product has a good flavor ,
but the water grows cold long before the beans stop being hardThis product might work better in a microwave -LRB- which I do not have so could not try -RRB- ,
but pouring boiling hot water into the cup was not enough .
The beans cook when heated in a pan on the stove top
bringing water to boil and then simmering for 10 minutes ... which defeats the purpose of having something fast in the office for lunch .
The product also contains 230 calories per cup which made it very high in compare to its small portionAdding the cup to a 1/2 cup of rice and cooking as according to rice recipe with a little extra water also makes a nice side dish for 2
