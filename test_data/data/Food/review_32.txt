Dr .
Danielle 's Organic Turmeric with Bioperine is amazing stuff .
I use it as a natural anti-inflammatory since I prefer not to use harsh pain killers .
I find that it helps relieve my migraines within 45mins of taking it
as long as I take it early on before the migraine has a chance to really take hold .
I love it and plan to use it for the rest of my life .
I also took one of the other consumers advise and brushed my teeth with it .
At first my teeth were a bright yellow brown but once I rinsed I was fine .
I did this for about a week and have a visably whiter smile .
Thanks for that tip , Maya .
