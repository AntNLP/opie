Though I was skeptical about this & # 34
instant & # 34
incarnation of the coffee that I greedily gulp down every morning
I must say that it 's the best instant coffee I 've ever had .
It 's not as complex or full-bodied as a fresh French press of Cafe Altura , of course ,
but , then , what is ?
A hot cup of their instant was as good as or better than many of the coffees out there .
It 'll definitely do the trick on those mornings when for whatever reason I ca n't make a full pot of the fresh-ground stuff .
Also
I 'm really looking forward to trying it iced when the weather turns warmer
as well as in recipes .
Good job !
