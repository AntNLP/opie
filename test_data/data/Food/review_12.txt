I suffer from Rhumatoid Arthritis which is a chronic inflammatory disorder that affects my hands and feet .
I have been warned that if I allow the painful swelling in my joints to get out of hand that it can eventually result in bone erosion and joint deformity so keeping it under control has been a huge goal of mine .
One of the best things I have tried .-Ibuprofen when the pain and swelling is really bad
