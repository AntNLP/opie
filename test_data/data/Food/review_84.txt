I tried a different brand of turmeric from Costco and while it worked somewhat
it did not take away all my pain .
I have nerve pain as well as muscle pain constantly because of how often I work out .
I decided to research on Amazon for a more pure and potent form of turmeric and came up with Dr .
Danielle organic turmeric .
Immediately I noticed the difference .
I started taking 2 a day , once in the morning and once at night ,
but when I have more pain I take one 3 times a day and have no pain .
I think I will stick with this brand because it really worked for my pain .
I also love the fact that it 's not some chemical and that the capsules are vegetarian .
Thanks for making this product .
