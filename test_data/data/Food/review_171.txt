We could n't find this product anywhere , until we saw it at amazon .
com , and it is a good quality walnut extract .
We used it to make maple cream liqueur , which needed the extract for the maple walnut taste ,
and this extract fit the bill !
Good product , and a good-sized bottle for the price .
