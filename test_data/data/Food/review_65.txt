I 've heard about the many great benefits on consuming curcumin .
As for it 's anti inflammatory response and the reduction of some of the associated pain that comes along with it .
So for me the peace of mind out ways the cost .
So I 'll keep taking it and if I had only one supplement to take this would be it .
The product was delivered fast and seems like a quality item , plus it 's organic !
