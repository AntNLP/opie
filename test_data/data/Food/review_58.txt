I read that it usually takes a while for turmeric to start having an anti-inflammatory effect .
I 've been taking 2-3 500mg curcumin doses a day for just over a month now ,
and feel that it is helping to minimize the aches and pains associated with some of the longer training runs -LRB- 16+ miles -RRB- .
Note : I have also been taking high doses of a ginger supplement ,
and omega-3 , both of which also have anti-inflammatory powers , for about the same amount of time .
But I am convinced that this turmeric supplement
coupled with ginger and omega-3 in my experience
is a potent and healthy substitute for NSAIDs ,
and I plan to continue use .
FWIW
I noticed that this pill is smaller and more `` turmeric-coloured '' than another turmeric supplement I tried prior .
They both report 500mg cucurma longa .
Maybe the other one -LRB- which was less orange
more yellow brown -RRB- had more black pepper in it.
