My husband and I originally bought turmeric because of all the studies we researched its benefits -LRB- anti depressant
improves insulin absorption
etc .
We originally tried a different curcumin -LRB- curcumin and turmeric are one in the same -RRB-
one that came without pepper and then found out pepper assists in the absorption dramatically .
I have to say that we did notice a difference from no curcumin to taking it .
We both had increased energy levels and did n't feel such a lethargy in the early evenings .
We chose this turmeric based on

This is my family 's standard brand for turmeric .
