I work out a lot and recently have been experiencing knee pain .
I had never had the issue before and actually thought I might have Lyme .
I ordered this product based on information gained from a large amount of Lyme sites stating the benefits of Curcumin -LRB- even if you do n't have Lyme -RRB- .
Fortunately , I my test came back negative for Lyme .
I still decided to take the product for its anti-flammatory benefits .
I have been taking the product for 2-3 weeks and have no knee pain most days .
When I do have knee pain , it is very slight .
