If you LOVE the combination of almonds and dark chocolate , you MUST try these .
Did you check out the ingredients ?

I am very grateful that Dulce Bean makes it easy for me to satisfy my sweet tooth ,

Sure the price is higher than most ,
but in my opinion the quality is above and beyond and worth every penny .
Everything I have tried by Dulce Bean is great -LRB- although these almond cookies are my favorite cookies -RRB- - if you like coconut try the Chocolate Chip Macaroons -LRB- http
