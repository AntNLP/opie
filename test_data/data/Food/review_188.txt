Finally , a more affordable alternative to Kona coffee from Hawai'i .
For a ground coffee , you ca n't go wrong .
Fans of Kona coffee will appreciate these beans from their island neighbor ,
and should be able to taste the similarities .
It is rich without being bitter and this dark roast is great for almost any occasion
be it a strong wake-up cup or and after dinner pick-me-up .
It is very similar to most mass produced Kona blends I 'd tried ,
but I was able to get a great deal on it at my local grocer during the initial push for the product .
I think it is worth the asking price ,
but try and find it in whole bean form for maxium flavor when you finally brew it .
This is a refined coffee for someone looking for a strong and flavorful cup .
Kauai 's Medium Roast is more mellow and likely will appeal to a broader audience ,
but this still better than most bagged coffees on the market ,
and for now it is priced right !
