I have yet to find an instant coffee that I really can say I prefer to the coffee I make with my k-cups .
This one will do just fine for a quick iced coffee or a grab and go emergency brew or for traveling .
My husband really liked the taste of it ,
but I
who like my coffee strong
used two teaspoons for my cup of coffee and found an unpleasant bitterness that lingered toward to back of my mouth .
The directions say to use one to two teaspoons of instant coffee to your taste .
I tried one teaspoon and it was too weak .
Again , taste is such a subjective thing ,
and my husband enjoyed the brew and said it reminded him of the coffee he drank years ago .
I should add that he is a WWII veteran and a native New Englander .
Because of our split opinion , I was able to give this product three stars .
Try it for yourself and see what you think ?
