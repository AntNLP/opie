For starters , the product was advertised as being 2.5lbs.
It was only 1lb in weight .
Thoroughly disappointing .
There were scores of other merchants offering the brazil nuts at a better price for 1lb .
Curious if this was unintentional .
Amazon made me whole on this purchase .
Will never order from this merchant again ...
