I planned to use this to flavor my black walnut stout .
Luckily , I tried it in a small portion before adding to the whole batch .
Tastes nothing like actual black walnut extract .
I know this because I make it myself ,
but short on walnuts to make it from right now .
Tastes surprisingly like pecan extract I purchased from another company .
I 'm sure it is & # 34 ; pure & # 34 ;
and & # 34 ; natural & # 34 ;
but not truly & # 34 ; real & # 34 ; black walnut .
