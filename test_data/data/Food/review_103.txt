Matcha Pocky is amazing .
This stuff is particularly delicious .
It 's a little different than the stuff I get in the local Asian market -LRB- made in a different country-Thailand vs .
Japan -RRB- and I like this one best .
Of note ,
and this is about the seller
not the product
I bought a 20-pack of this for a great price and when I went back to buy more about 6 weeks later it had DOUBLED in price .
Before
this was a bulk purchase that offered a decent savings over what I pay in the local Asian market .
Now
it 's more than I would pay to buy it locally and no longer a good deal at all .
Too bad .
