This product was delicious !
My 14 month old son liked these , I think they taste just like strawberry milk .
I alternate giving these to him instead of the & # 34
Horizon chocolate milk with DHA & # 34
.
These are travel size and the straws work well .
They do n't have to be refrigerated unless they 've been opened ,
but it does say to serve cold .
He has n't had any reaction to anything that is in this product .
I liked them so much I got the adult version .
