I was so happy to find another organic supplement !
I take about 20 or more supplements a day in order to keep my older body functioning at its best .
Knowing I am getting organic and with a high level of Bioperine for the highest absorption is just an added plus to the many advantages turmeric gives .
I got our daughter to take this supplement for pain instead of using Motrin and prescription meds and she was surprised to find it worked as well without the side effects .
I am thankful that more companies such as Dr .
Danielle are making quality organic supplements and I look forward to seeing more products added soon .
