I have become a coffee snob over the years
finally settling on a French Press to provide the best tasting coffee in the mornings .
I rarely have drip coffee anymore , and am even less likely to have instant coffee .
While traveling in Europe many B & B 's have Nescafe in the rooms and I bought some for the times I just do n't want to have to deal with the clean up of a French press or coffee pot but this is much better .
I can honestly say that Caf & eacute ; Altura is a high quality ,
and exceptional tasting instant coffee .
I found the flavor to be wonderfully smooth with no bitterness .
As an FYI , it mixes up brown , not black .
It certainly ca n't replace the complexity and depth of French press coffee ,
but for times when I am feeling lazy and still want something that taste pretty darned good
this meets my needs .
As a bonus , it is also great for recipes .
