Pleased and surprised by this one .
Having only used the beans or grounds for many years
it 's been a very long time since I would have called any instant & # 34
really good & # 34
coffee ,
but this one is really good .
I prefer a dark , rich coffee flavor and this one delivers it easily .
Definitely recommended .
