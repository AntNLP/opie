First off , I was amazed at how quickly this item was delivered .
I live in Hawaii and expected the usual shipping delays we learn to live with but much to my surprise
it arrived with the rest of the stuff I ordered that day .
I 'm pleased with the quality of the wheat berries .
I suppose I should try sprouting some just to see how fertile they are but I do n't care much about sprouts .
I do know it makes excellent flour though .
I put a couple of pounds in my Lee home flour mill and let her whine .
I used the hard red wheat berries exclusively for my first batch of bread and I loved it .
If you do n't know the pleasure of fresh baked bread made from just milled flour you do n't know what bread is all about .
I do n't add white flour to my bread trying to get a lighter loaf .
I get a nice loaf with this wheat going through my Lee mill .
What 's interesting about PalouseBrand is the QR Code affixed to the bag that takes you to the location on Google maps where the wheat was harvested .
Nice touch .
I happened to have gone to school at Washington State University and probably drove past that field many times over the years .
Brings back some fond memories .
