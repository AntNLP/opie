I honestly ca n't figure why anyone would give this a high rating .
It 's nothing but orange colored sugar water .
It was so sweet , it made the glands in my neck spasm !
No kidding !
I could n't even begin to taste passion fruit juice .
Perhaps it is a bad batch or perhaps some people are conditioned to drink sugar water ,
but whatever the reason , it 's going back right now .
