I started taking Curcumin as the result of a meeting with an Ayurvedic doctor .
I was suffering from allergies and had low Agni -LRB- digestive fire -RRB- .
I have almost finished my first bottle and I have to say that I am sleeping better and am having better digestion
less heartburn and less itching .
I am very pleased with this product .
