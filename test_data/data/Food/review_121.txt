I am a daily coffee drinker and am picky about the beans and taste of coffee .
So , I 've never been one to drink instant coffee ,
and times I have tried instant coffee 's they were awful .
Cafe Altura a pleasant surprise .
The first time I tried it I only used one spoonful for a 12 oz .
cup , and it was too weak .
The next time I tried two spoonfuls and it was strong and could almost pass as fresh brewed -LRB- but it was a little & # 34
flat & # 34
tasting compared to fresh brewed -RRB- .
Still
in a pinch if I run out of beans or ground coffee
this would get me by for a cup or two .
If you like the convenience of instant coffee , this would be the one to have .
