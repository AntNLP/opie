I have been using tumeric for several months now after having some intense tendonitis in my wrist .
I work with my hands so I cant have that .
I understand that NSAIDS can interfere with ligament healing although they can block the pain and so I wanted something to combat the inflammation naturally .
Tumeric is it .
There are so many other healthy benefits to it as well if you read up on it .
I had been taking another brand of tumeric for a while until I read some more on it and realized that without black pepper -LRB- bioperrine -RRB-
it is very difficult to absorb tumeric .
The reasons I bought this brand are these
-Made in USA by a real medical professional
not a faceless corporation-Organic-has black pepper for absorption-the price was rightI dont know of another brand that satisfies all of those criteria
