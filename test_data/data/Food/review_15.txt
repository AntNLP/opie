I recently started a regimen of natural supplements including Turmeric and several medicinal mushroom supplements after reading clinical reports suggesting potential benefits of these supplements for those battling various types of cancers .
Turmeric is also touted as a strong anti-inflammatory supplement ,
so while time will tell about whether this will help in tumor suppression
I have seen empirical evidence of improvements associated with my eczema that has been haunting me for decades .
This brand of Turmeric claims to be organic ,
and for this combination of turmeric and BioPerine the price of this product is very reasonable .
I have seen no negative side effects from using this product ,
and will continue to do so as part of my new health regimen .
