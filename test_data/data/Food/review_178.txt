Tried this at a friend 's house and it 's truly disgusting .
If you read the ingredient label the first ingredient after filtered water is sugar , not passion fruit .
This is nothing but flavored sugar water , not a healthy juice drink .
It has just as many calories as your average can of soda and almost as much sugar .
If you want passion fruit juice there are loads of better and healthier options than this overly sweetened concoction .
Beware of the positive reviews on this product
at least one of them is from a paid shill account -LRB- CQueen -RRB- that at this time has left over 50 negative reviews on competing products in order to promote this product .
Only shady companies whose product ca n't stand on it 's own have to resort to such deceptive tactics and I would n't be surprised if all of the 5 star reviews they have right now came from people that work for the company .
