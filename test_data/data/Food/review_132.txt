I 've been using more instant coffee rather than brewing a pot and wasting the leftovers .
This offering is smooth , flavorful and full-bodied without a bite .
The jar lid takes a little getting used to because it 's not the usual screw top .
My morning zombie-self has finally gotten used to it after a few close calls of nearly spilling the precious contents .
This is a great option for a Free Trade alternative .
