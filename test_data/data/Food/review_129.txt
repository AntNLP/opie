All I can say is this stuff is amazing !
I always thought Mount Hagen had the best instant organic coffee on the planet but now
I 'd have to say Cafe Altura has filled the 1st place slot !
To me it tastes like freshly brewed coffee .
There is no bitter aftertaste .
It is smooth & delicious with cream & sugar .
