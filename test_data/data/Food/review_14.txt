I 've been hearing about turmeric for a while now .
I 've heard it is a great alternative to many medications including aspirin , arthritis medications and steroids .
It 's also said to protect the heart
lower cholesterol
improve liver function and reduce the risk of many cancer without any side effects !
Now I do n't know if most of this is true but I do know that it has helped me with inflammation of my joints and intestines -LRB- I know
gross -RRB- .
I also have not experienced any side affects .
Plus , it 's organic !
I will be purchasing another bottle when this one runs out .
