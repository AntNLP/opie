I 've been using instant coffee for years and have settled on Taster 's choice as the only one that remotely resembles brewed coffee .
I was n't expecting much in flavor from this coffee but was I pleasantly surprised .
This makes a rich intense cup of coffee and I need to use about half of what I normally use to make myself a nice cuppa .
So even though they cost more than the equivalent amount of taster 's choice I think this may end up giving me close to the same amount of cups .
The flavor is strong and there is a mild bitterness to it but nothing overwhelming .
I like that it comes in two jars since a lot of aroma gets lost by the time I plow through my big Costco jar of Taster 's choice .
The granules dissolve well and make a good cold as well as hot cup of coffee .
All in all
even without considering the environmental impact and the importance of Fair Trade
this is a great instant coffee !
