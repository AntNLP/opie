I started using Curcumin about 2 months ago .
I was taking an Aleve every night for hip and low back pain but was concerned about long-term use .
I am a landscaper and so have a very physically demanding -LRB- and sometimes painful !
job .
I take one Curcumin in the morning and one at night and I can definitely feel the difference in pain
swelling and achiness .
No more Aleve for me !
My wife is also a big fan .
She takes Curcumin for the anti-inflammatory effects
as she suffers from two auto-immune conditions where inflammation is a major component .
I have recommended Curcumin to my sister who has diabetes
as I have read Curcumin can really help with this disease as well .
