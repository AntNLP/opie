In my experience , freeze dried coffee is generally weak and less than flavorful .
Cafe Altura is just the opposite .
Following the package 's instructions produces a strong , full bodied cup similar to espresso ,
and perfect for adding cream and sugar .
The fact that it is organic and fair trade adds to the pleasure .
While it is not equal to brewed coffee
it is certainly an excellent substitute when just one quick cup is needed .
