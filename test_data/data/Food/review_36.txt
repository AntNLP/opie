I started using this product to help with inflammation in my knees .
I am a runner and have knee issues including osteo arthritis .
I had a major surgery on one of my knees a year ago and have a small meniscus tear in my other knee .
I have trouble with inflammation and pain , my knees feel tight and swollen quite a bit .
I did n't want to take Advil or Aleve all the time so I decided to try Turmeric .
It definitely seems to be helping .
I have been taking it for close to a month and have noticed my knees are not as sore and inflammed ,
and they do n't feel so tight when I bend my knees while squating or stretching my quads .
I feel comfortable taking this product .
It is organic and natural with no side effects .
