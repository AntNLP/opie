I use freeze dried/instant coffee often for recipes and in a pinch when I either run out of regular or I want a slightly different flavor .
This coffee comes in a great glass bottle and has a very pleasing shape - including that it is easy to open and it fits nicely in the cupboard .
The flavor is pretty good - it 's medium/slightly darker level roast to me but not so dark that it is like liquid oil .
I found it pretty easy to use soy and almond milk in this -LRB- I 'm a vegan -RRB- to lighten it - although the soy just worked better with the flavor .
Not uncommon as frequently soy works better than almond milk in coffee .
The flavor is good - it has a slight aftertaste and is not bitter but close too - maybe a little tart -LRB- ?
Not sure how best to describe it .
Definitely rich and full bodied for an instant .
It was awesome in the recipes -LRB- Smoothies
brownies -RRB- and really imparted a & # 34
I can taste the coffee in this & # 34
flavor without overpowering .
I liked it straight to drink as well -LRB- with aforementioned creamer and some stevia -RRB- .
