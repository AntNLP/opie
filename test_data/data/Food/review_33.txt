Call me strange for spending the money on an organic supplement for my dog but my dog Thumpy is part of the family and more than worth the expense .
Thumpy is 7 years old now and a german shepard .
For over the past year and a half now she has been having issues getting up and running around like she use to .
Translation- she is getting up there in age and her body just is n't what it use to be .
I personally have taken turmeric in the past for inflammation and joint pain and so have many of my family memebers .
It works great !
It is a magic root that goes right to the source to help ease the aches and pains and that is exactly the effect it has been having on my Thumpy .
Within 3 weeks she was getting up with no problems .
She is back to chasing the ball like she use to although I have cut back on how long I will let her run for because I do n't want to agrevate her joints .
I am so happy that it works for her just like it has worked for my family and I in the past .
Turmeric is wonderful and safe for humans and dogs alike .
