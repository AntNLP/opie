I 'm not a connoisseur of coffee , so the instant kind works well for me .
Now honestly
I do n't taste a difference between the Altura Freeze Dried coffee and the Taster 's Choice brand I normally drink .
On the other hand
I do prefer the packaging of this product
which most likely costs about the same as the Taster 's Choice instant coffee .
I use only a little more than a teaspoon serving for each cup ,
and perhaps I should try 2 teaspoons and see how much stronger it is .
As far as I 'm concerned though , instant coffee is faster and easier to make ,
and in the long run a lot cheaper .
