This organic curcumin has a strong smell to it
which tells me it is fresh and good quality .
I like the fact that it is organic ,
and I 'm also pleased that it does n't contain any magnesium stearate .
Seems to be helping with my joints , as I am having less soreness throughout the day .
I plan to keep using it !
