Some people complained that these tasted old , stale , or otherwise atypical for allsorts .
I did not have that experience at all .
They arrived on time and the quality is great .
My only issue -LRB- if I 'm really looking for one -RRB- might be that there is an uneven variety/distribution of the types of allsorts in the bag -LRB- heavy on the cubed kind and light on the coconut-y ones -RRB- .
