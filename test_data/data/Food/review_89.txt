Ever look at a supplement you are taking and then find all these crazy scary ingredients in the `` other '' section on the label ?
Scary , right !
Like what the heck is titanium dioxide and how the heck is that what I ordered
why do I want that in my body ,
and how dare you try and trick me into taking something I did n't order ?
I have had no ill side effect taking this organic curcumin and I am SOOOO relieved when I find a company that goes out of their way to not add s*** to their pills .
I know what I am putting in my body and its exactly what I wanted- ORGANIC turmeric with Bioperine .
Nothing else .
