I like coffee and I think this makes a very good cup of it .
Not at all like the flavor of usual instant coffees .
It is strong -- for me
I do n't need to use 2 full teaspoons -- so easy ,
so inexpensive ,
so convenient .
I was surprised that not only does it succeed as coffee ,
but its also a pretty jar that reflects philosophical practices that I support : Fair trade and organic .
If you have an open mind about instant coffee -LRB- and do n't expect it to be exactly like what you usually make ,
but still very good -RRB- -- I highly recommend this .
-LRB- Nice addition to a gift basket
imo
with the & # 34
fair trade and organic & # 34 ;
and attractive packaging .
