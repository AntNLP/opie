While it is freeze dried and instant , there is no denying the quality .
I have gotten used to Keurig coffee , Starbucks ,
and other expensive caffiene delivery mechanisms ,
so was somewhat skeptical about trying instant coffee .
Believe me , this is no nescafe or folgers - this is the real deal ,
and only the highly attuned palette will be able to distinguish from this coffee and fresh drip coffee .
I am truly impressed , and as an added bonus , it is fair trade .
Would not hesitate to recommend .
