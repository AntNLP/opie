I really notice when I forget to take Turmeric for a few days
the inflamation in my knees causes a slight pain telling me so .
I 've gone back and forth , and overall I can say that it does help me .
What I like about this brand is that they offer it organically , and in a veggie capsule .
And the cost is very low for what you get .
I like it .
