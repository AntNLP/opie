For ground coffee , you ca n't go wrong .
Fans of Kona coffee will appreciate these beans from their island neighbor and should be able to taste the similarities .
It is rich without being bitter and this medium roast is the perfect coffee for almost any occasion
be it your first morning cup
an afternoon refresher ,
or and after dinner pick-me-up .
Itis very similar to most mass produced Kona blends I 'd tried ,
but I was able to get a great deal on it at my local grocer during the initial push for the product .
That said , I still think it is worth the asking price .
This is a refined coffee for someone looking for a mellow yet flavorful cup .
Kauai 's Bold Roast is a bit stronger , but still better than most .~ Kort
