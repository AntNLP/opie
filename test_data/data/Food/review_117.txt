I really love my coffee but I limit my daily intake ,
so I only drink what I consider the very best .
This makes me quite the coffee snob
from the coffee I buy to the way I prepare it .
I do enjoy Starbucks when I 'm out and about but at home I am extremely particular about my coffee and prefer organically grown .
For several years I tasted many
many organic coffees in search of THE one which pleased my palate best .
I tasted many good ones and a few great ones but never found the one that I was completely satisfied with
that is until I came across Caf & eacute
Altura here at Amazon about four years ago .
For me Cafe Altura is the supreme coffee .
I ca n't tell you how much I love this coffee !
I am a very early riser and this coffee is my first waking thought every morning .
Usually I make myself a single cup pour-over with a cone and filter and I useCafe Altura Organic Coffee
Regular Roast
Ground
12-Ounce Cans -LRB- Pack of 3 -RRB- which is my absolute favorite .
When I need to make coffee for more than just myself I use my French press and I always get compliments with Caf & eacute
Altura .
I was therefore very excited to be offered to try this new fair trade organic
freeze dried coffee from Caf & eacute
Altura through Amazon 's Vine program .
I never drink instant coffee and do n't particularly care for it but I was very curious to see how Caf & eacute
Altura 's freeze dried would compare to its regular roast .
Let me tell you something - this instant coffee is fantastic and every drop is as sublime as the regular roast !
I only buy organically grown coffee and Caf & eacute
Altura is 100 % organically grown
fair trade
non GMO verified Arabica beans from Africa
Asia and South America .
The flavor and aroma of this superior freeze dried coffee intoxicate me as much as a fresh brew .
It is a medium roast with a full bodied depth that is smooth and low acidic .
I have also discovered how wonderful this instant coffee is in my baking .
I love the combination of coffee and chocolate in my gluten-free vegan cakes
cookies and brownies and I can ramp up that exquisite coffeehouse flavor easily with Caf & eacute
Altura freeze dried coffee .
Because some instant coffee varieties are not gluten-free or free of other allergens
I can use this instant coffee with confidence inasmuch as its ingredients are 100 % certified Arabica coffees only .
