I plan to update my review as I take more .
So far so good as a lot of spices and herbs make me sick .
I am hoping this will help in my energy level and I will report as I progress in taking the turmeric .
The order arrived very fast and I did read many reviews before I ordered .
So presently , all I can give is 3 stars since it 's only been a few capsules .
I am doing an update .
I have taken about 1/2 of the bottle .
I do feel like I am energized a little more .
I believe also that this is helping with my constipation issues .
I plan to try the `` Bee Well '' capsules along with this product .
Will update at a later date .
