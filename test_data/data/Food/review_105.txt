I noticed these two pretty square bottles with their colorful labels came in a double thick easy open box made especially for them .
Right then I figured this must be some extra good instant coffee .
And I was right .
Great .
Now I wo n't be able to get my instant coffee at the store any more ,
since it does n't compare with this .
This is rich
full bodied
flavorful and all the other adjectives you can heap on a great coffee .
It tastes the way you always hope your cup of coffee will taste .
No way does this taste like standard instant coffee .
There 's no comparison .
In fact I am now wondering why I should bother with my usual French Press method of making coffee when I can simply put a teaspoon of this into a cup of hot water and have better coffee .
The jar simply says it is made from African , Asian and South American coffee .
I ca n't explain it .
I just can drink it .
And I will .
As long as Amazon sells it .
Good stuff .
