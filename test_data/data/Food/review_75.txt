This vitamin seems to be working .
I try to take three times daily -LRB- maximum dosage instructed -RRB- .
I currently have MS
with moments of leg weakness
stiffness and balance -LRB- amplified with humid weather -RRB- .
After a week , I 've felt some changes in my leg strength for the better ,
but i have a long way to go and will continue to take thus .
