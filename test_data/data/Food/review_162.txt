Sent a few boxes to my parents as I gift .
They loved them , they thought they were an amazing little treat .
To be fair in this review they had never tried Macarons so they did n't have a previous experience to base this product on .
However they are great cooks and love food and if they liked I 'm sure you will too .
Delivery was timely and product arrived as expected .
