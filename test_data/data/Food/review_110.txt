While growing up
my parents always used instant coffee except when they had a large number of people over .
Then they broke out the large percolator and the ground coffee .
A few years later I got my first job washing dishes in a diner and was introduced to `` restaurant quality '' drip coffee from the Bunn-O-Matic .
Fast-forward a few decades and now I 'm spoiled .
I like a decent cup from a drip coffee maker , or even better yet , my Keurig .
With that in mind
I thought it would be interesting to see if this new Cafe Altura Freeze Dried Instant Coffee was good enough to replace my K Cups
as they claimed .
-LRB- See the copy on the Amazon product page .
The short answer is , `` No .
The long answer is a bit more detailed .
First of all this coffee has some pluses not found in your average supermarket instant coffee
It 's organic and non-GMO ,
and it 's Fair Trade .
These characteristics are important to me and I try to purchase coffee with these qualities as often as possible .
Having said that
one thing is perfectly clear when you drink this
it 's still instant coffee .
I made test samples with two heaping spoons of coffee and 8 ounces of boiling water .
I also added sugar and half-and-half to the cup .
Instant coffee has a certain characteristic about it so that no matter how good it is a
it always has that `` instant coffee '' flavor to it .
To me this coffee has a flavor similar to `` better '' instants such as Tasters Choice ,
but it still is unmistakably instant coffee .
And it has that lingering `` instant '' aftertaste that remains a long time after you have finished your cup .
So for me , if I 'm out of ground coffee this will suffice ... barely .
For Mrs .
Boilermate , not so much .
She , too , made her samples with two heaping spoons of coffee and 8 ounces of water .
She , however , drinks her black .
Her comment
`` I feel the same way about instant coffee as you do about artificial sweeteners and this coffee does nothing to change that .
I ca n't stand anything with artificial sweetener in it .
I do n't like the flavor artificial sweeteners impart to anything they contaminate ,
and they have a nasty aftertaste that lingers for seemingly forever .
So I guess that means she did n't like it .
It does have a saving grace , however .
I like coffee flavored yogurt and a couple of spoons of this mixed into plain yogurt is awesome .
Mocha brownies ?
Yes , please !
Bottom LineWe wo n't be drinking this as our morning coffee ,
but it has earned a space in the cupboard for those times when we want to add a rich coffee flavor to other foods .
