I stumbled across this in a local Grocery Outlet and tried a bottle & # 8212
then bought out their stock ,
and now am trying to source it online .
Why ?
Two words : dietary fiber .
Each 11.5oz bottle has 8g of it .
For a ready-made , convenient and tasty fruit drink that 's downright awesome .
I 'm no passionfruit connoisseur or health-food guru ,
and I ca n't compare it to other , similar products ,
but for a random grocery-store find I genuinely enjoyed this
enough to go out of my way to buy it again .
Yes
it 's sweet -LRB- and at 160 calories per bottle probably has more sugar than it should -RRB- ,
but it 's a fruit-punch sort of sweet ,
and the sugar is downright pleasant compared to the high-fructose-corn-syrup crap most Americans drink all the time .
If you are looking for a good introduction to passionfruit drinks ,
or a huge fiber boost that 's WAY nicer than cardboard cereals or fiber bars
this might meet your needs the way it does mine .
