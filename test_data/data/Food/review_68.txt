Absolutely the highest quality .
I have switched from another brand to Dr .
Danielle 's after significant research around bio-availability .
This brand focused not only on a high quality product but making sure that the product is designed in a way that your body can actually process .
Additionally the veggie caps are something that aligns to my personal diet and makes me feel highly confident when people ask me about my arsenal of supplements that this is one that I can recommend without any caveats .
High quality product that stands up to what it advertises .
