i love dry soda !
i found this product a few years ago while shopping at a store where i could buy just 1 to try it out .
have been hooked ever since !
they have a fun list of flavors to choose from .
with these sodas , you do n't get a lot of sugar , but a lot of flavor !
if you too can appreciate the heavily carbonated with a delicate flavor- this is your soda !
just do n't expect it to be syrupy with sugars like most sodas ... if your tired of the same old- same old sodas ... give them a try !
