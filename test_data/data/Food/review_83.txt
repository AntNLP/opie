I have arthritis in both knees and a historically high hsCRP number
I 've been taking Certo in blueberry/pomegranate juice for the former and I 'm on a wheat-free diet for the latter .
While my knees have been doing well and my hsCRP has been lower
I 'm still open to trying other things for inflammation control .
The People 's Pharmacy web site mentioned curcumin as a natural anti-inflammatory with no known side effects ,
so I thought I 'd give it a try .
Before I began researching the products available on Amazon
I was unaware of the issues about binders and other additives in curcumin tablets or the advantages of combining curcumin with Bioperine .
Once my research brought those matters to light
it became an easy choice to purchase this particular curcumin formulation .
I 've been taking 1 tablet per day for about a month ,
and am scheduled for my next round of lab tests in July ,
so we 'll see how much extra benefit I get from it by then .
