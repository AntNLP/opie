arrived in good shape to my house .
these beans are eaten daily by my family in all sorts of great meals
they go great with everything especially pasta .
they have incredible flavor and are amazingly satisfying
they so are great to have in the fridge so you can make a quick tasty meal .
these are the beans from the whole foods antipasto bar , but they are far cheaper here .
i would recommend this seller -LRB- Peters Select -RRB- the shipping was free and was very quick .
this is simply the best food ive ever eaten from a can
everyone that has tried them cant get enough of them
im so happy to pay a 3rd of the price of what whole foods sells them for .
i could n't recommend these more highly
