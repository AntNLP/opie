Cafe Altura has put out a superior environmentally conscious product for as long as I can remember .
Nice to see they are branching out into a freeze dried line that is certainly needed and wanted .
We do n't use a lot of freeze-dried coffee but it is something we always have on hand for baking
travel and quick fixes when time is short .
Keep up the good work and thanks for putting out such a great product .
