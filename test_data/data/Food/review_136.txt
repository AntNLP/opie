I am not a pushover for faddish drinks - I tried a certain energy drink recently ,
and thought I was going to gag .
But , I know what I like , and I like the Izze All Natural Sparkling Juices !
This stuff is made with 70 % natural fruit juices -LRB- from concentrate -RRB- ,
some sparkling water ,
and not a whole lot else & # 8211 ; no kidding !
This stuff is excellent , with a well-rounded , adult taste , and some light bubbling for fun .
Now
as you might expect with something made mostly of fruit juice
it & # 8217
s got a lot of natural sugars in it ,
but it is not artificially sweetened ,
and there is absolutely no corn syrup anywhere in this stuff .
I have tried many of their flavors and liked them all & # 8211 ; especially the blackberry !
So , let me just say that this stuff is great , and I really like it .
It surprises me when I get to the bottom of the can ,
and then I start thinking that I should get another one ,
and keep the party going & # 8211 ; the party in my taste buds !
