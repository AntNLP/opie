I have been on prescription anti-inflammatory drugs for several years now because of joint pain in my hips and back pain .
I decided to give Turmeric a try since the spice is known for its anti-inflammatory components .
I like this product because it is organic , there are no side effects .
I stopped taking the prescription drugs and starting taking Tumeric
I found that it helps with the stiffness and aches that I have .
As long as it continues to help , I will continue to take this supplement .
