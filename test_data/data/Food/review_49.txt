I originally bought this product to give to my aging Shar Pei who has arthritis and swollen hock syndrome -LRB- FSF -RRB- in hope that a natural supplement would give her some relief .
After several days I started noticing a difference in her gait and she was getting around better .
Now almost 2 months into use I can say that my girl is spunky
more playful than she 's been in years .
No side affects and works better than I ever expected .
I will be a repeat customer and also recommend for the two legged people that have inflammation
arthritis or joint issues !
