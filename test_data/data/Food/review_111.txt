I really like this coffee clean , full flavor that is consistent from cup to cup .
While the price is on the higher side
if you think about what you would pay for a cup of coffee at a chain or local coffee should this is an okay deal .
The rectangular jar is a nice addition for reuse with a easy to open top that is also easy to close .
