I love these red beans and rice cups ,
and am so glad Amazon finally got them in stock as I have n't been able to get them after the stores around me stopped selling them .
They are really easy to make and taste great .
A little spicy , but I am a light-weight in that category .
They are very filling with the rice and red beans .
I can not recommend these enough !
