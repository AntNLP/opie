I have tried many different brands of turmeric ,
and after so many reviews and research , I discovered Turmeric Curcumin by Dr .
Danielle .
Since taking it , I really can say I feel so much better ,
and there are no fillers , binders or additives !
One of the most important things I learned about turmeric is that it aids in fighting cancer cells and also this brand has bioperine which is key for absorption !
Many brands of turmeric do not have bioperine and some contain fillers and additives .
So I highly recommend this particular brand by Dr .
Danielle .
