I must confess I am not a one to search out and pay extra for organic foods .
In most cases I will admit that its probably better for you ,
but the cost and the fact that often I have tasted no difference in many foods has me going traditional most often .
However in the case of this Cafe Altura coffee
I really do n't know if its the fact that its organic that makes it so delicious ,
or just that its damn fine coffee to begin with .
In any event , this stuff makes some of the very best coffee I have ever tasted .
I mean full bodied , flavorful , no bitterness , just a simply delicious brew all around .
And do n't let its light color fool you .
It makes a stronger cup of coffee than any dark blend I have come across for sure .
This coffee is so good it can easily take the place of a brewed blend ,
and not just be considered for a quick cup ,
or when you are out of your regular coffee ...
Even though the price may seem a little high
you will easily get 50 cups out of this bottle using a little more than the regular level teaspoon ,
and trust me , the coffee it makes is well worth it .
Highly , and deliciously recommended ... : -RRB-
