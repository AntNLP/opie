As a cancer survivor , I 'm very particular on the supplements I take .
I did a lot of research and decided to try Dr .
Danielle 's Turmeric- I showed the bottle to my doctor .
He agreed that it could only help not hurt .
After 5 weeks- I feel an improvement in joint pain in knees and hands .
I will continue to take in hopes it may help with my foot and hand neuropathy post chemo .
I prefer this to my previous medication- Celebrex .
Try it - it may change your life ... ... .
