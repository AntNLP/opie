I have RA and curcumin was recommended by both my doctor and friends with RA .
I began looking at the various brands and was most attracted by Dr .
Danielle 's product description and the reviews of her formulation .
I like the fact that it is organic and has the bioperine to help the curcumin absorb .
I 've only been taking it for a couple weeks ,
but so far I 'm very happy with the results .
I will update my review as time progresses .
I plan on making Dr .
Danielle 's Organic Curcumin a long-term supplement to relieve my joint pain and inflammation .
