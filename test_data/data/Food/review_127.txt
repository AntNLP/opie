I am not a coffee snob ,
but I am pretty picky and I like my fresh brewed & # 34 ; joe .
That said , Altura is my current favorite brand ,
and I was hoping that they did as good a job with their instant as thei did with their regular coffee .
I am pleased to report , they did do a good job .
Now
bearing in mind that instant is NEVER as good as fresh
there still is quite a spectrum of taste in the world of instant coffee .
This instant coffee is far more palatable than any other I have tasted ,
and I 've tasted a lot .
I can safely say
if you like Altura 's regular coffee
then you will find this a very acceptable instant .
It is better than many coffees I have gotten fresh at restaurants and coffee stands -LRB- a sad comment in itself -RRB- .
I would drink this before I would drink most & # 34
regular & # 34
brands of fresh coffee on store shelves
not just because of the taste ,
but due to Altura 's attention to quality all the way from the plantation .
They walk their talk .
Recommended for those times when you need instant , and when you ca n't get good fresh coffee .
