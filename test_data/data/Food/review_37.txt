There are many Tumeric Curcumin products out there ,
but I chose this brand -LRB- Dr Danielle 's -RRB- for two main reasons
First it is organic
which is very important to me ;
and two , it contains BioPerine -LRB- pepper -RRB- which increases bioavailability .
I have noticed a decrease in aches and pains after several bottles of use .
I will continue to use this brand going forward .
