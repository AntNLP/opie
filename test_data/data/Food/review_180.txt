I love this .
I received the order quickly .
I added some ice and it 's so good after a long day of work especially under hot So Cal heat .
It 's kind of difficult to find passion fruit juice at my local markets .
There is concentrate available at my market but it tastes funny after diluting with water .
I am glad Markizza is available on Amazon .
