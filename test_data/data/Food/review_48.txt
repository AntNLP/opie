For the price
this is the best combination of curcumin and bioperine I 've found - I 've been using for a while now and it seems to help my arthritis .
Note that curcumin needs to be taken with bioperine to be effective .
Nice that this this is free from fillers and other non-essential -LRB- and potentially harmful -RRB- ingredients .
