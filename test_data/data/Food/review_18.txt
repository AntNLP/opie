I read about strong antioxidant power of curcumin so I decided to try Dr Danielle 's as it is organic and is made in the USA under strict GMP standards .
So I believe in good results from this company and hope to see improvement in my skin appearance pretty soon .
Overall after taking it for a week I feel good and energized so I think it works .
