m typically a coffee snob so I tend to shy away from freeze-dried coffee .
This product however , is exceptional .
When I compared this coffee with even the chain stores -LRB- green and white logo -RRB- I definitely prefer this coffee .
Deep and rich without much bitterness .
The fact this is both fair trade and organic makes it even more irresistible .

ll keep using my French Press
Aeropress and other ground coffee accessories for everyday drinking .
Having this jar around prevents me from the horror of running out of beans and having to run to the grocery store in an emergency .
Yes , running out of coffee in my home is an emergency .
