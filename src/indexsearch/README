Build
================
Following command will generate opie-indexsearch.jar

% ./build.sh


Doc format
================
Files to be indexed should be orgnized in the manner of sentence-per-line. 
Each line is in column format (separated by tab):

  pickleid-sentid   sentence_contents

The following is an example file:

  1-2   good bye

The frist line represents that the first sentence in pickle file #1 is "hello
world", and the second sentence in picle file #1 is "good bye".

================
The main class: antnlp.opie.indexsearch.IndexFiles

Usage: 
% java antnlp.opie.indexsearch.IndexFiles [-index INDEX_PATH] [-docs DOCS_PATH] [-update]

This indexes the documents in DOCS_PATH, creating a Lucene indexin INDEX_PATH that can be searched with SearchFiles

================
The main class: antnlp.opie.indexsearch.SearchFiles

Usage:	java antnlp.opie.indexsearch.SearchFiles [-index dir] [-field f] [-repeat n] [-queries file] [-query string] [-raw] [-paging hitsPerPage]
